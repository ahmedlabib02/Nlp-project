            "array([b'Bullfighting ( or ;  or ), also known as tauromachia or tauromachy ( , ; from  \"bull-fight\"),  is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, parts of southern France and some Latin American countries (Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Peru),[http://www.cas-international.org/es/home/sufrimiento-de-toros-y-caballos/corridas-de-toros/corridas-de-toros-en-latinoamerica/ Corridas de Toros en Latinoam\\xc3\\xa9rica] in which one or more bulls are fought by humans in a bullring. Although it can be defined as a blood sport, within the areas where it is practiced it is not considered a sport, since there are no elements of competition. Instead, it is considered a highly ritualized cultural event and art form which some see as deeply tied to Hispanic culture and identity.  \\n \\nThe bullfight, as it is practiced today, involves professional toreros (of whom the most senior, who actually kills the bull, is called a matador) who execute various formal moves which have a meaning, or at least a name, according to the bullfighter\\'s style or school. It has been alleged that toreros seek to elicit inspiration and art from their work and an emotional connection with the crowd transmitted through the bull. The close proximity places the bullfighter at risk of being gored or trampled by the bull. After the bull has been hooked multiple times behind the shoulder by other toreros in the arena, the bullfight usually concludes with the killing of the bull, ideally by a single sword thrust, which is called the estocada. Sometimes, the life of the bull is spared due to his braveness (indulto); once the animal has been treated, it is returned to live in the dehesa. Such pardons are nevertheless rare. In Portugal, the finale consists of a tradition called the pega, where men (forcados) try to grab and hold the bull by its horns when it runs at them.\\n\\nA special breed of cattle is used for bullfighting, and the bulls involved must be bred in large ranches, in conditions as similar as possible to the way they would behave in the wild.\\n\\nThere are many historic fighting venues in the Iberian Peninsula, France and Latin America. The largest venue of its kind is the Plaza M\\xc3\\xa9xico in central Mexico City, which seats 48,000 people,  and the oldest are the Plazas of B\\xc3\\xa9jar and Ronda, in the Spanish provinces of \\xc3\\x81vila and M\\xc3\\xa1laga.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nBullfighting traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice in Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean region. The first recorded bullfight may be the Epic of Gilgamesh, which describes a scene in which Gilgamesh and Enkidu fought and killed the Bull of Heaven (\"The Bull seemed indestructible, for hours they fought, till Gilgamesh dancing in front of the Bull, lured it with his tunic and bright weapons, and Enkidu thrust his sword, deep into the Bull\\'s neck, and killed it\").  Bull leaping was portrayed in Crete, and myths related to bulls throughout Greece. The killing of the sacred bull (tauroctony) is the essential central iconic act of Mithras, which was commemorated in the mithraeum wherever Roman soldiers were stationed. The oldest representation of what seems to be a man facing a bull is on the Celtiberian tombstone from Clunia and the cave painting El toro de hachos, both found in Spain.  \\n\\nBullfighting is often linked to Rome, where many human-versus-animal events were held as competition and entertainment, the Venationes. These hunting games spread to Africa, Europe and Asia during Roman times. There are also theories that it was introduced into Hispania by the Emperor Claudius, as a substitute for gladiators, when he instituted a short-lived ban on gladiatorial combat. The latter theory was supported by Robert Graves (picadors are related to warriors who wielded the javelin, but their role in the contest is now a minor one limited to \"preparing\" the bull for the matador.) Spanish colonists took the practice of breeding cattle and bullfighting to the American colonies, the Pacific and Asia. In the 19th century, areas of southern and southwestern France adopted bullfighting, developing their own distinctive form.\\n\\nReligious festivities and royal weddings were celebrated by fights in the local plaza, where noblemen would ride competing for royal favor, and the populace enjoyed the excitement. In the Middle Ages across Europe, knights would joust in competitions on horseback. In Spain, they began to fight bulls.\\n\\nIn medieval Spain bullfighting was considered a noble sport and reserved to the rich, who could afford to supply and train their animals. The bull was released into a closed arena where a single fighter on horseback was armed with a lance. This spectacle was said to be enjoyed by Charlemagne, Alfonso X the Wise and the Almohad caliphs, among others. The greatest Spanish performer of this art is said to have been El Cid.  According chronicle of the time, in 1128 \"... when Alfonso VII of Le\\xc3\\xb3n and Castile married Berengaria of Barcelona  daughter of Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona at \\nSalda\\xc3\\xb1a among other celebrations, there were also bullfights.\" \\n \\n\\nFrancisco Romero, from Ronda, Spain, is generally regarded as having been the first to introduce the practice of fighting bulls on foot around 1726, using the muleta in the last stage of the fight and an estoque to kill the bull. This type of fighting drew more attention from the crowds. Thus the modern corrida, or fight, began to take form, as riding noblemen were replaced by commoners on foot. This new style prompted the construction of dedicated bullrings, initially square, like the Plaza de Armas, and later round, to discourage the cornering of the action.\\n\\nThe modern style of Spanish bullfighting is credited to Juan Belmonte, generally considered the greatest matador of all time. Belmonte introduced a daring and revolutionary style, in which he stayed within a few centimetres of the bull throughout the fight. Although extremely dangerous (Belmonte was gored on many occasions), his style is still seen by most matadors as the ideal to be emulated.\\n\\nStyles\\n\\nOriginally, at least five distinct regional styles of bullfighting were practised in southwestern Europe: Andalusia, Aragon\\xe2\\x80\\x93Navarre, Alentejo, Camargue, Aquitaine. Over time, these have evolved more or less into standardized national forms mentioned below. The \"classic\" style of bullfight, in which the bull is killed, is the form practiced in Spain and many Latin American countries.\\n\\nSpanish\\n\\nSpanish-style bullfighting is called corrida de toros (literally \"running of bulls\") or la fiesta (\"the festival\"). In the traditional corrida, three matadores each fight two bulls, each of which is between four and six years old and weighs no less than 460\\xc2\\xa0kg (1,014\\xc2\\xa0lb)  Each matador has six assistants\\xe2\\x80\\x94two picadores (\"lancers on horseback\") mounted on horseback, three banderilleros \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who along with the matadors are collectively known as toreros (\"bullfighters\") \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and a mozo de espadas (\"sword page\"). Collectively they comprise a cuadrilla (\"entourage\"). In Spanish the more general torero is used for the lead fighter, and only when needed to distinguish a man is the full title matador de toros used; in English, \"matador\" is generally used for the bullfighter.\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nThe modern corrida is highly ritualized, with three distinct stages or tercios (\"thirds\"); the start of each being announced by a bugle sound. The participants enter the arena in a parade, called the pase\\xc3\\xadllo, to salute the presiding dignitary, accompanied by band music. Torero costumes are inspired by 17th-century Andalusian clothing, and matadores are easily distinguished by the gold of their traje de luces (\"suit of lights\"), as opposed to the lesser banderilleros, who are also known as toreros de plata (\"bullfighters of silver\").\\n\\nTercio de Varas\\n\\nThe bull is released into the ring, where he is tested for ferocity by the matador and banderilleros with the magenta and gold capote (\"cape\"). This is the first stage, the tercio de varas (\"the lancing third\"). The matador confronts the bull with the capote, performing a series of passes and observing the behavior and quirks of the bull.\\n\\nNext, a picador enters the arena on horseback armed with a vara (lance). To protect the horse from the bull\\'s horns, the animal wears a protective, padded covering called peto.  Prior to 1930, the horses did not wear any protection. Often the bull would disembowel the horse during this stage. Until the use of protection was instituted, the number of horses killed during a fiesta generally exceeded the number of bulls killed. \\n\\nAt this point, the picador stabs just behind the morrillo, a mound of muscle on the fighting bull\\'s neck, weakening the neck muscles and leading to the animal\\'s first loss of blood. The manner in which the bull charges the horse provides important clues to the matador about which side the bull favors. If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns slightly lower during the following stages of the fight. This ultimately enables the matador to perform the killing thrust later in the performance. The encounter with the picador often fundamentally changes the behaviour of a bull; distracted and unengaging bulls will become more focused and stay on a single target instead of charging at everything that moves.\\n\\nTercio de Banderillas\\n\\nIn the next stage, the tercio de banderillas (\"the third of banderillas\"), each of the three banderilleros attempts to plant two banderillas, sharp barbed sticks, into the bull\\'s shoulders. These anger and agitate, but further weaken, the bull. He tires from his  attacks on the horse and the damage he has taken from the lance. Sometimes a matador will place his own banderillas. If so, he usually embellishes this part of his performance and employs more varied manoeuvres than the standard al cuarteo method commonly used by banderilleros.\\n\\nTercio de Muerte\\n\\nIn the final stage, the tercio de muerte (\"the third of death\"), the matador re-enters the ring alone with a small red cape, or muleta, and a sword. It is a common misconception that the color red is supposed to anger the bull; the animals are colorblind.   The cape is thought to be red to mask the bull\\'s blood, although the color is now a matter of tradition. The matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes, which serve the dual purpose of wearing the animal down for the kill and creating an interesting display, or faena. He may also demonstrate his domination of the bull by caping and bringing it especially close to his body. The faena refers to the entire performance with the cape (muleta).\\n\\nIt is usually broken down into tandas, or \"series\", of passes. The series (tanda) ends with a final series of passes in which the matador, using the cape, tries to maneuver the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The sword is called estoque, and the act of thrusting the sword is called an estocada. During the initial series, while the matador in part is performing for the crowd, he uses a fake sword (estoque simulado). This is made of wood or aluminum, making it lighter and much easier to handle. The estoque de verdad (real sword) is made out of steel. At the end of the tercio de muerte, when the matador has finished \\nhis faena, he will change swords to take up the steel one. He performs the estocada and kills the bull with a pierce through the heart, if all goes according to plan. Many times the bull does not get pierced through the heart during the estocada initially, and repeated efforts must be made to bring the bull down and end his life.\\n\\nIf the matador has performed particularly well, the crowd may petition the president by waving white handkerchiefs to award the matador an ear of the bull. If his performance was exceptional, the president will award two ears. In certain more rural rings, the practice includes award of the bull\\'s tail. Very rarely, if the public or the matador believe that the bull has fought extremely bravely, the event\\'s president may be petitioned to grant the bull a pardon (indulto). If the indulto is granted, the bull\\'s life is spared; it leaves the ring alive and is returned to its home ranch. There the bull becomes a stud for the rest of his life.\\n\\nFile:Finito de C\\xc3\\xb3rdoba.jpg|First tercio: torero drawing a Ver\\xc3\\xb3nica.\\nFile:Rafael Ca\\xc3\\xb1ada \\xc3\\xa0 la cape.jpg|First tercio: matador making another kind of Ver\\xc3\\xb3nica.\\nFile:Banderillero Curro Molina.jpg|Second tercio: banderillero.\\nFile:Madrid Bullfight.JPG|Third tercio: faena of muleta.\\nFile:Uceda Leal.JPG|Third tercio: faena of muleta.\\n\\nRecortes\\n\\nRecortes, a style of bullfighting practiced in Navarre, La Rioja, north of Castile and Valencia, has been much less popular than the traditional corridas. But recortes have undergone a revival in Spain and are sometimes broadcast on TV.\\n\\nThis style was common in the early 19th century. Etchings by painter Francisco de Goya depict these events.\\n\\nRecortes claims to differ from a corrida in the following ways:\\n* The bull is not physically injured. Drawing blood is rare, and the bull is allowed to return to his pen at the end of the performance.\\n* The men are dressed in common street clothes rather than traditional bullfighting dress.\\n* Acrobatics are performed without the use of capes or other props. Performers attempt to evade the bull solely through the swiftness of their movements.\\n* Rituals are less strict, so the men have freedom to perform stunts as they please.\\n* Men work in teams but with less role distinction than in a corrida.\\n* Teams compete for points awarded by a jury.\\n\\nSince horses are not used, and performers are not professionals, recortes are less costly to produce.\\n\\nComic bullfighting\\n\\nComical spectacles based on bullfighting, called espect\\xc3\\xa1culos c\\xc3\\xb3mico-taurinos or charlotadas, are still popular in Spain and Mexico. Troupes include El empastre or El bombero torero. \\n\\nEncierros \\n\\nAn encierro or running of the bulls is an activity related to a bullfighting fiesta. Before the events that are held in the ring, people (usually young men) run in front of a small group of bulls that have been let loose, on a course of a sectioned-off subset of a town\\'s streets.\\n\\nToro embolado\\n\\nA toro embolado (in Spanish), bou embolat (in Catalan), roughly meaning \"bull with balls\", is a festive activity held at night and typical of many towns in Spain (mainly in the Valencian Community and Southern Catalonia). Balls of flammable material are attached to a bull\\'s horns. The balls are lit and the bull is set free in the streets at night; participants dodge the bull when it comes close. It can be considered a variant of an encierro (correbous in Catalan). This activity is held in a number of Spanish towns during their local festivals. In recent years, animal welfare activists have tried to stop the practice because of cruelty to the animal.    \\n\\nPortuguese\\n\\nMost Portuguese bullfights are held in two phases: the spectacle of the cavaleiro, and the pega. In the cavaleiro, a horseman on a Portuguese Lusitano horse (specially trained for the fights) fights the bull from horseback. The purpose of this fight is to stab three or four bandeiras (small javelins) into the back of the bull.\\n\\nIn the second stage, called the pega (\"holding\"), the forcados, a group of eight men, challenge the bull directly without any protection or weapon of defence. The front man provokes the bull into a charge to perform a pega de cara or pega de caras (face grab). The front man secures the animal\\'s head and is quickly aided by his fellows who surround and secure the animal until he is subdued.   Forcados are dressed in a traditional costume of damask or velvet, with long knitted hats as worn by the campinos (bull headers) from Ribatejo.\\n\\nThe bull is not killed in the ring and, at the end of the corrida, leading oxen are let into the arena and two campinos on foot herd the bull among them back to its pen. The bull is usually killed out of sight of the audience by a professional butcher. It can happen that some bulls, after an exceptional performance, are healed, released to pasture until their end days and used for breeding.\\n\\nIn the Portuguese Azores islands, there is a form of bullfighting called tourada \\xc3\\xa0 corda, in which a bull is led on a rope along a street, while players taunt and dodge the bull, who is not killed during or after the fight, but returned to pasture and used in later events.\\n\\nFrench\\n\\nSince the 19th century, Spanish-style corridas have been increasingly popular in Southern France where they enjoy legal protection in areas where there is an uninterrupted tradition of such bull fights, particularly during holidays such as Whitsun or Easter. Among France\\'s most important venues for bullfighting are the ancient Roman arenas of N\\xc3\\xaemes and Arles, although there are bull rings across the South from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coasts. Bullfights of this kind held in France are no different from those held in Spain and Latin America excepting minor cosmetic differences such as music. This is not to be confused with the bloodless bullfights referred to below which are indigenous to France.\\n\\nCourse camarguaise (course libre)\\n\\nA more indigenous genre of bullfighting is widely common in the Provence and Languedoc areas, and is known alternately as \"course libre\" or \"course camarguaise\". This is a bloodless spectacle (for the bulls) in which the objective is to snatch a rosette from the head of a young bull. The participants, or raseteurs, begin training in their early teens against young bulls from the Camargue region of Provence before graduating to regular contests held principally in Arles and N\\xc3\\xaemes but also in other Proven\\xc3\\xa7al and Languedoc towns and villages. Before the course, an abrivado\\xe2\\x80\\x94a \"running\" of the bulls in the streets\\xe2\\x80\\x94takes place, in which young men compete to outrun the charging bulls. The course itself takes place in a small (often portable) arena erected in a town square. For a period of about 15\\xe2\\x80\\x9320 minutes, the raseteurs compete to snatch rosettes (cocarde) tied between the bulls\\' horns. They do not take the rosette with their bare hands but with a claw-shaped metal instrument called a raset or crochet (hook) in their hands, hence their name. Afterwards, the bulls are herded back to their pen by gardians (Camarguais cowboys) in a bandido, amidst a great deal of ceremony. The stars of these spectacles are the bulls, who get top billing and stand to gain fame and statues in their honor, and lucrative product endorsement contracts. \\n\\nCourse landaise\\n\\nAnother type of French \\'bullfighting\\' is the \"course landaise\", in which cows are used instead of bulls. This is a competition between teams named cuadrillas, which belong to certain breeding estates. A cuadrilla is made up of a teneur de corde, an entra\\xc3\\xaeneur, a sauteur, and six \\xc3\\xa9carteurs. The cows are brought to the arena in crates and then taken out in order. The teneur de corde controls the dangling rope attached to the cow\\'s horns and the entra\\xc3\\xaeneur positions the cow to face and attack the player. The \\xc3\\xa9carteurs will try, at the last possible moment, to dodge around the cow and the sauteur will leap over it. Each team aims to complete a set of at least one hundred dodges and eight leaps. This is the main scheme of the \"classic\" form, the course landaise formelle. However, different rules may be applied in some competitions. For example, competitions for Coupe Jeannot Lafittau are arranged with cows without ropes.\\n\\nAt one point, it resulted in so many fatalities that the French government tried to ban it, but had to back down in the face of local opposition. The bulls themselves are generally fairly small, much less imposing than the adult bulls employed in the corrida. Nonetheless, the bulls remain dangerous due to their mobility and vertically formed horns. Participants and spectators share the risk; it is not unknown for angry bulls to smash their way through barriers and charge the surrounding crowd of spectators. The course landaise is not seen as a dangerous sport by many, but \\xc3\\xa9carteur Jean-Pierre Rachou died in 2003 when a bull\\'s horn tore his femoral artery.\\n\\nSimilar customs in other countries \\n\\nTamil Nadu (India)\\n\\nJallikattu is a traditional bull-taming sport played in Tamil Nadu, India as a part of Pongal celebrationson Mattu Pongal day. Bulls are bred specifically for the sporting event and a specific breed of cattle bred for this purpose is known as \"Jellicut\".  In May 2014, the Supreme Court of India banned the sport citing animal welfare issues, although the sport does not involve killing the animal.  On 8 January 2016, the Government of India passed an order exempting Jallikattu from all performances where bulls can not be used, effectively reversing the ban.  This order of the Government of India was overturned by the  Supreme Court by its judgement on 12 January 2016 and will be effective at least for one year.\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\n  \\nFreestyle bullfighting is a style of bullfighting developed in American rodeo. The style was developed by the rodeo clowns who protect bull riders from being trampled or gored by an angry bull. Freestyle bullfighting is a 70-second competition in which the bullfighter (rodeo clown) avoids the bull by means of dodging, jumping and use of a barrel.\\nCompetitions are organized in the US as the \"World\" Bullfighting Championship (WBC) and the Dickies National Bullfighting Championship under auspices of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR).\\n\\nA distinct type of bloodless bullfighting is practised in California\\'s Central Valley. In this historically Portuguese-settled area, a form of bullfight has developed in which the bull is taunted by a matador, but the lances are tipped with velcro and aimed at velcro patches secured to the bull\\'s shoulder. Fights occur from May through October around traditional Portuguese holidays. \\n\\nTanzania\\n\\nBullfighting was introduced by the Portuguese to Zanzibar and to Pemba Island, in modern Tanzania, where it is known as mchezo wa ngombe. Similar to the Portuguese Azorean tourada a corda, the bull is restrained by a rope, generally neither bull nor player is harmed, and the bull is not killed at the end of the fight.  \\n\\nBull wrestling (bull against bull)\\n\\n \\nBull wrestling, or bull fighting, is a bloodsport between bulls found in some parts of the world, such as in India (known as dhirio), Japan (t\\xc5\\x8dgy\\xc5\\xab),  Balkans (korida),  Turkey (bo\\xc4\\x9fa g\\xc3\\xbcre\\xc5\\x9fi, literally \"bull wrestling\"),  Persian Gulf,   and Southeast Asia, in which the bulls lock horns (under varied rules). This form of bullfighting is also practiced in western Kenya.\\n\\nHazards\\n\\nSpanish-style bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, but it is also dangerous for the matador. Matadors are usually gored every season, with picadors and banderilleros being gored less often. With the discovery of antibiotics and advances in surgical techniques, fatalities are now rare, although over the past three centuries 534 professional bullfighters have died in the ring or from injuries sustained there, most recently matador Victor Barrio on 10 July 2016, whose death was broadcast on live TV.  \\n\\nSome matadors, notably Juan Belmonte, have been seriously gored many times: according to Ernest Hemingway, Belmonte\\'s legs were marred by many ugly scars. A special type of surgeon has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat cornadas, or horn-wounds.\\n\\nThe bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida, and where a priest can be found in case a sacrament is needed. The most relevant sacrament is now called \"Anointing of the Sick\"; it was formerly known as \"Extreme Unction\", or the \"Last Rites\".\\n\\nThe media often reports the more horrific of bullfighting injuries, such as the September 2011 goring of matador Juan Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Padilla\\'s head by a bull in Zaragoza, resulting in the loss of his left eye, use of his right ear, and facial paralysis. He returned to bullfighting five months later with an eyepatch, multiple titanium plates in his skull, and the nickname \\'The Pirate\\'. \\n\\nCultural aspects\\n\\nMany supporters of bullfighting regard it as a deeply ingrained, integral part of their national cultures; in Spain it is called \"La fiesta nacional\", literally \"the national festival\". The aesthetic of bullfighting is based on the interaction of the man and the bull. Rather than a competitive sport, the bullfight is more of a ritual of ancient origin, which is judged by aficionados (bullfighting fans) based on artistic impression and command. Ernest Hemingway said of it in his 1932 non-fiction book Death in the Afternoon: \"Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter\\'s honour.\" Bullfighting is seen as a symbol of Spanish culture. \\n\\nThe bullfight is regarded as a demonstration of style, technique and courage by its participants and as a demonstration of cruelty and cowardice by its critics. While there is usually no doubt about the outcome, the bull is not viewed by bullfighting supporters as a sacrificial victim \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it is instead seen by the audience as a worthy adversary, deserving of respect in its own right.\\n\\nThose who oppose bullfighting maintain that the practice is a cowardly, sadistic tradition of torturing, humiliating and killing a bull amidst pomp and pageantry.  Supporters of bullfights, called \"aficionados\", claim they respect the bulls, that the bulls live better than other cattle, and that bullfighting is a grand tradition; a form of art important to their culture. \\n\\nWomen in bullfighting\\n\\nSee also: List of female bullfighters\\n\\nPatricia McCormick began bullfighting as a professional Matadora in January 1952, and was the first American to do so. Bette Ford was the first American woman to fight on foot in the Plaza M\\xc3\\xa9xico, the world\\'s largest bullfight arena. \\n\\nConchita Cintron was a Peruvian female bullfighter, perhaps the most famous in the history of bullfighting.\\n\\nIn 1974, Angela Hernandez (also known as Angela Hernandez Gomez and just Angela), of Spain, won a case in the Spanish Supreme Court allowing women to be bullfighters in Spain; a prohibition against women doing so was put in place in Spain in 1908.   Cristina S\\xc3\\xa1nchez de Pablos, of Spain, was one of the first female bullfighters to gain prominence; she debuted as a bullfighter in Madrid on 13 February 1993.\\n\\nPopularity, controversy, and criticism\\n\\nPopularity\\n\\nIn Spain, opposition to bullfighting is referred to as the antitaurino movement. Supporters of a ban on bullfighting remain a minority in Spain. About 30% of Spaniards support bullfighting in Spain. Despite its slow decrease in popularity among younger generations, it remains a widespread cultural activity with millions of followers throughout the country.\\n\\nAnimal welfare\\n\\n \\nMany people, including animal rights and animal welfare advocates, consider this is a cruel, barbaric blood sport in which the bull suffers severe stress, and may ultimately end in a slow, torturous death.     A number of animal rights and animal welfare groups undertake anti-bullfighting actions in Spain and other countries. \\n\\nRSPCA assistant director for public affairs, David Bowles, said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe RSPCA is strongly opposed to bullfighting. It is an inhumane and outdated practice that continues to lose support, including from those living in the countries where this takes place such as Spain, Portugal and France.\" \\n\\nBullfighting guide The Bulletpoint Bullfight warns that bullfighting is \"not for the squeamish\", advising spectators to \"Be prepared for blood.\" The guide details prolonged and profuse bleeding caused by horse-mounted lancers; the charging by the bull of a blindfolded, armored horse who is \"sometimes doped up, and unaware of the proximity of the bull\"; the placing of barbed darts by banderilleros; followed by the matador\\'s fatal sword thrust. The guide stresses that these procedures are a normal part of bullfighting and that death is rarely instantaneous. The guide further warns those attending bullfights to \"Be prepared to witness various failed attempts at killing the animal before it lies down.\" \\n\\nOthers, such as author Alexander Fiske-Harrison have argued that there are mitigating circumstances to this: \"In terms of animal welfare, the fighting bull lives four to six years whereas the meat cow lives one to two. What is more, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just live in the sense of existing, it lives a full and natural life. Those years are spent free roaming in the dehesa, the lightly wooded natural pastureland which is the residue of the ancient forests of Spain. It is a rural idyll, although with the modern additions of full veterinary care and an absence of predators big enough to threaten evolution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s answer to a main battle tank.\" Other arguments include that the death of animals in slaughterhouses is very often worse than the death in the ring, and that both types of animal die for entertainment since humans do not need to consume meat, eating it instead for taste (bulls enter the food chain after the bullfight). \\n\\nFunding\\n\\nThe question of public funding is particularly controversial in Spain, since widely disparaged claims have been made by supporters and opponents of bullfighting. According to government figures, bullfighting in Spain generates 1600 million euros a year and 200,000 jobs, 57000 of which are directly linked to the industry. Furthermore, bullfighting is the cultural activity which generates the most tax revenue for the Spanish state (45 million euros in VAT tax and over 12 million in social security).\\n\\nCritics claim often that bullfighting is financed with public money. However, despite bullfighting involving around 25 million spectators annually, it represents just 0.01% of those state subsidies allocated to cultural activities, and always under 3% of the cultural budget of regional, provincial and local authorities. The bulk of subsidies are paid by local town halls where there is a historical tradition and support for bullfighting and related events, which are often held without charge to participants and spectators. The European Union does not subsidize bullfighting but it does subsidize the cattle farming in general, which benefits also benefit those who rear Spanish fighting bulls. \\n\\nIn 2015, 438 of 687 Members of the European Parliament (MEP) voted in favour of amending the 2016 E.U. budget to indicate that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP) appropriations or any other appropriations from the budget should not be used for the financing of lethal bullfighting activities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. While the E.U. cannot legislate to ban bullfighting, it can stop granting farming subsidies to bull breeders. These subsidies have been keeping practice of bullfighting alive.  \\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nLate-19th-century / early-20th-century Fin-de-si\\xc3\\xa8cle Spanish regeneracionista some intellectuals protested against what they called the policy of pan y toros (\"bread and bulls\"), an analogue of Roman panem et circenses promoted by politicians to keep the populace content in its oppression. Such belief was part of the wider current of thought known as anti-flamenquismo whereby they simultaneously campaigned against the popularity of both bullfighting and flamenco music, which they believed to be \"oriental\" elements of Spanish culture which were responsible for Spain\\'s backwardness as compared to the rest of Europe. During the Franco dictatorship, bullfights were supported by the state as something genuinely Spanish, as the fiesta nacional, so that bullfights became associated with the regime and, for this reason, many thought they would decline after the transition to democracy, but this did not happen. The government of Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Luis Rodr\\xc3\\xadguez Zapatero, was the first to be more opposed to bullfighting, prohibiting children under 14 from attending and limiting or prohibiting the broadcast of bullfights on national TV, although the latter measure was reversed after his party lost the elections in 2011. Nevertheless, his party is overall not opposed to bullfighting and anti-bullfighting measures have only been passed in municipalities where it governs in coalition with the far-left party Podemos which has taken a clearer anti-bullfighting stance. However, even Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has recently stated that even though he is opposed to it, he would not illegalize bullfighting if his party came to power. \\n\\nSome in Spain despise bullfighting because of its association with the Spanish nation and the Franco regime.  Despite its long history in Barcelona, in 2010 bullfighting was outlawed across the Catalonia region, following a campaign led by an animal rights civic platform called \"Prou!\" (\"Enough!\" in Catalan). Critics have argued that the ban was motivated by issues of Catalan independentism.\\n\\nThe Spanish Royal Family is divided on the issue, from Queen Sof\\xc3\\xada who does not hide her dislike for bullfights;  to King Juan Carlos who occasionally presides over a bullfight from the royal box as part of his official duties;    to their daughter Princess Elena who is well known for her liking of bullfights and who often accompanies the king in the presiding box or attends privately in the general seating. \\nThe King has allegedly stated that \"the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU\". \\n\\nPro-bullfighting supporters include the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his party (Partido Popular), as well as most leaders of the major left-leaning opposition PSOE Party, including former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the current Presidents of Andalusia, Extremadura and Castilla-La-Mancha. Nevertheless, former PSOE Prime Minister Zapatero was more lukewarm towards the Fiesta, and under his government there was a 6-year ban on live bullfights broadcast on the state-run national TV Channel. This has been lifted since his government was voted out in 2011. Live Bullfights are shown at the traditional 6 p.m. time on TVE as of September 2012. \\n\\nReligion\\n\\nBullfighting has been seen as intertwined with religion and religious folklore in Spain at a popular level, particularly in the areas where it is most popular.    Bullfighting events and festivities are as a rule celebrated as a core (yet profane) element of religious festivities celebrating local Patron Saints, always along a range of other festive activities. On the other hand, the Bullfighting world is also inextricably linked to religious iconography involved with religious devotion in Spain, with Bullfighters seeking the protection of various Virgins and often being members of religious brotherhoods.  \\n\\nMedia prohibitions\\n\\nState-run Spanish TVE had cancelled live coverage of bullfights in August 2007 until September 2012, claiming that the coverage was too violent for children who might be watching, and that live coverage violated a voluntary, industry-wide code attempting to limit \"sequences that are particularly crude or brutal\".  In October 2008, in a statement to Congress, Luis Fern\\xc3\\xa1ndez, the President of Spanish State Broadcaster TVE, confirmed that the station will no longer broadcast live bullfights due to the high cost of production and a rejection of the events by advertisers. However the station will continue to broadcast \\'Tendido Cero\\', a bullfighting magazine programme.  Having the national Spanish TV stop broadcasting it, after 50 years of history, was considered a big step for its abolition. Nevertheless, other regional and private channels keep broadcasting it with good audiences. \\n\\nThe Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his government have lifted the ban on live bullfights being shown on TVE and live bullfights are now shown at the traditional 6 p.m. time on TVE as of September 2012.\\n\\nA Portuguese television station stopped broadcasting of bullfights in January 2008, on the grounds that they were too violent for minors. \\n\\nDeclaration as Cultural Patrimony\\n\\nA growing list of Spanish, French and South American cities and regions have started to formally declare their celebrations of bullfighting part of their protected cultural patrimony. Most of these declarations have come into place as a counter-reaction in the aftermath of the 2010 ban in Catalonia. \\n\\nAs of April 2012, the latest addition to this list is the Andalusian City of Seville. \\n\\nBans\\n\\nPre-20th century\\n\\nIn November 1567, Pope Pius V issued a papal bull titled De Salute Gregis and forbidding fighting of bulls and any other beasts as the voluntary risk to life endangered the soul of the combatants, but it was abolished eight years later by his successor, Pope Gregory\\xc2\\xa0XIII, at the request of King Philip\\xc2\\xa0II.\\n\\nBullfighting was introduced in Uruguay in 1776 by Spain and abolished by Uruguayan law in February 1912. Bullfighting was also introduced in Argentina by Spain, but after Argentina\\'s independence, the event drastically diminished in popularity and was abolished in 1899 under law 2786. \\n\\nBullfighting was present in Cuba during its colonial period, but was abolished by the United States military under the pressure of civic associations right after the Spanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93American War in 1901.  Bullfighting was also banned for a period in Mexico in 1890; consequently some Spanish bullfighters moved to the United States to transfer their skills to the American rodeos. \\n\\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, bullfighting in Spain was banned at several occasions  (for instance by Philip\\xc2\\xa0V), but always reinstituted later by other governments.\\n\\nBullfighting had some popularity in the Philippines during Spanish rule, though foreign commentators derided the quality of local bulls and toreros.   Bullfighting was noted in the Philippines as early as 1619, when it was among the festivities in celebration of Pope Urban III\\'s authorisation of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.  Following the Spanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93American War, the Americans suppressed the custom in the Philippines under the tenure of Governor General Leonard Wood, and it was replaced with a now-popular Filipino sport, basketball. \\n\\n20th century onwards\\n\\nBullfighting is now banned in many countries; people taking part in such activity would be liable for terms of imprisonment for animal cruelty. \"Bloodless\" variations, though, are permitted and have attracted a following in California, Texas, and France.  In southern France, however, the traditional form of the corrida still exists and it is protected by French law. However, in June 2015 The Paris Court of Appeals removed bullfighting/\"le corrida\" from France\\'s cultural heritage list.    While it is not very popular in Texas, bullfighting is legal (the only U.S. state to allow it), and both bloodless and pure forms of bullfighting occur at rodeos in small Texas towns.[http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?sectionnews/local&id\\n6200136 Bullfighting is coming to Ft. Bend County | abc13.com]\\n\\nIn 1991, the Canary Islands became the first Spanish Autonomous Community to ban bullfighting, when they legislated to ban bullfights and other spectacles that involve cruelty to animals, with the exception of cockfighting, which is traditional in some towns in the Islands. \\nSome supporters of bullfighting and even Lorenzo Olarte Cullen,  Canarian head of government at the time, have argued that the fighting bull is not a \"domestic animal\" and hence the law does not ban bullfighting. \\nThe absence of spectacles since 1984 would be due to lack of demand.\\nIn the rest of Spain, national laws against cruelty to animals have abolished most blood sports, but specifically exempt bullfighting.\\n\\nSeveral cities around the world (especially in Catalonia) have symbolically declared themselves to be Anti-Bullfighting Cities, including Barcelona in 2006. This was symbolic, as the city did not have the power to stop it. However, on 1 January 2012, it became prohibited in Catalonia (including Barcelona, the capital of this region) after a ban passed in the Regional Government in July 2010 came into effect in 2012. \\n\\nCatalonia\\n\\nOn 18 December 2009, the parliament of Catalonia, one of Spain\\'s seventeen Autonomous Communities, approved by majority the preparation of a law to ban bullfighting in Catalonia, as a response to a popular initiative against bullfighting that gathered more than 180,000 signatures.  On  2010, with the two main parties allowing their members a free vote, the ban was passed 68 to 55, with 9 abstentions. This meant Catalonia became the second Community of Spain  (first was Canary Islands in 1991), and the first on the mainland, to ban bullfighting. The ban took effect on 1 January 2012, and affects only the one remaining functioning Catalonian bullring, the Plaza de toros Monumental de Barcelona. \\nIt does not affect the correbous, a traditional game of the Ebro area (south of Catalonia) where lighted flares are attached to a bull\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horns. The correbous are seen mainly in the municipalities in the south of Tarragona, with the exceptions of a few other towns in other provinces of Catalonia. The name correbous is essentially Catalan and Valencian; in other parts of Spain they have other names.[http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_27265.shtml#ixzz10NKQxwpk Now Cataloniaa votes to protect the torture of bulls]\\n\\nThere is a movement to revoke the ban in the Spanish congress, citing the value of bullfighting as \"cultural heritage\". The proposal is backed by the majority of parliamentarians. \\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nIn Costa Rica the law prohibits the killing of bulls and other animals in public and private shows. \\n\\nEcuador\\n\\nEcuador staged bullfights to the death for over three centuries due to being a former Spanish colony. On 12 December 2010, Ecuador\\'s president Rafael Correa announced that in an upcoming referendum, the country would be asked whether to ban bullfighting;    in the referendum, held in May 2011, the Ecuadorians agreed on banning the final killing of the bull that happens in a corrida.  This means the bull is no longer killed before the public, and is instead taken back inside the barn to be killed at the end of the event. The other parts of the corrida are still performed the same way as before in the cities that celebrate it.[http://quaker-animals.co.uk/?p=2650 Analysis Of The Ecuador Referendum \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bullfight] This part of the referendum is applied on a regional level, meaning that in regions where the population voted against the ban, which are the same regions where bullfighting is celebrated the most, killing the animal publicly in the bullfighting plaza is still performed. The main bullfighting celebration of the country, the Fiesta Brava in Quito was still allowed to take place in December 2011 after the referendum under these new rules. \\n\\nMexico\\n\\nBullfighting has been banned in three Mexican states: Sonora in 2013, Guerrero in 2014 and Coahuila in 2015. \\n\\nIndia\\n\\nAnimal activists and PETA India have protested against Jallikattu over the years.  The Animal Welfare Board of India filed a case in the Supreme Court of India for an outright ban on Jallikattu because of the cruelty to animals and the threat to public safety involved. On 27 November 2010, the Supreme Court permitted the Government of Tamil Nadu to allow Jallikattu for five months in a year and directed the District Collectors to make sure that the animals that participate in Jallikattu are registered to the Animal Welfare Board and in return the Board would send its representative to monitor over the event. The Government of Tamil Nadu ordered that  be deposited by the organizers in case of an accident or injury during the event and enacted a rule to allow a team of veterinarians would be present at the venue for certifying the bulls for participation in the event and to provide treatment for bulls that get injured. \\n\\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests issued a notification in 2011 that banned the use of bulls as performing animals, thereby banning the sport.  But the sport was continued to be held under Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act No 27 of 2009. On 7 May 2014, the Supreme Court of India struck down the state law and banned the sport. The Supreme Court noted that any flouting of the ban should result in penalties for cruelty to animals under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.  The court also asked the Government of India to amend the law on preventing cruelty to animals to bring bulls within its ambit. On 8 January 2016, the Ministry of Environment and Forests permitted the continuation of the sport under certain conditions effectively ending the ban.',\n",
            "       b'Paso Doble, (meaning double-step in Spanish) is a Spanish light music, with a binary rhythm and moderated movement, probably based in typical Spanish dances of the 16th century. During the 18th century it was incorporated to comedies and was adopted as a regulatory step for the Spanish infantry, with a special feature that makes the troops can take the regular step: 120 steps per minute. The music was introduced in bullfights during the 19th century. It is played during the bullfighters\\' entrance to the ring (paseo) or during the passes (faena) just before the kill. It corresponds to the pasodoble dance (traditional and ballroom).\\n\\nPaso Doble is a lively style of dance to the duple meter march-like pasodoble music. It is modelled after the sound, drama, and movement of the Spanish and Portuguese bullfight. The traditional couple\\'s dance was originated in France and then adopted in Spain and Portugal. \\n\\nFamous bullfighters have been honoured with pasodoble tunes named after them.

The leader of this dance plays the part of the matador.  The follower generally plays the part of the matador\\'s cape, but can also represent the shadow of the matador, as well as the flamenco dancer in some figures. The follower never represents the bull, althrough it is commonly thought this way.\\nIts origin dates back to a French military march with the name \"Paso Redoble.\" This was a fast paced march, which is why this is a fast-paced Latin American dance modeled after the Spanish bullfight. Bullfighting was well known around this time.\\n\\nBallroom\\n\\nA significant number of pasodoble songs are variations of Espa\\xc3\\xb1a Ca\\xc3\\xb1i. The song has breaks or \"highlights\" in fixed positions in the song (two highlights at syllabus levels, three highlights and a longer song at Open levels). Highlights emphasize music and are more powerful sounding than other parts of the music, usually, dancers have decoration trick and then the position that is to be held to the end of the highlight.  Traditionally pasodoble routines are choreographed to match these highlights, as well as the musical phrases. Accordingly, most other ballroom pasodoble tunes are written with similar highlights (those without are simply avoided in most competitions).\\n\\nBecause of its inherently choreographed tradition, ballroom pasodoble for the most part is danced only competitively, almost never socially, or without previously learned routine. This said, in Spain, France, Vietnam, Colombia,  Costa Rica and some parts of Germany it is danced socially as a lead (not choreographed) dance. In Venezuela, pasodoble is almost a must-have dance in weddings and big parties, being especially famous by the song \"Guitarra Espa\\xc3\\xb1ola\" by Los Mel\\xc3\\xb3dicos.\\n\\nIn competitive dance, modern pasodoble is combined with other four dances (samba, cha-cha-cha, rumba and jive) under the banner International Latin. Modern pasodoble dance consists of two dancing parts and one break in between for dancers of class D and of three parts and two breaks in between for dancers of class C, B, A, according to the IDSF classification.  Dancers of lower than D-class usually perform only four official dances of Latin-American Program.'],\n",

            "array([b\"Latin American Guide: History Of The Paso Doble Dance\\nHistory Of The Paso Doble Dance\\nBy Melanie LaPatin\\nWho says the French can't be Spanish? Witness the Paso Doble. Meaning double step in Spanish, this ballroom dance for couples is set to Spanish march music that is reminiscent of a bullfight in the heart of Spain.\\nIt is the same style of music that is played when a bullfighter enters the ring to salute the audience before the fight, and again at the end of the fight, just before the kill. This assumes, of course, that the bull doesnt win the fight.\\nThe dance is lively and dramatic, with long sweeping steps and aggressive movements. It is a dance of preparation for battle and triumph in combat, just like the bullfights that inspired it. The male represents the matador, boldly and proudly entering the ring. The female represents the matadors cape, which he whips around with graceful elegance. The female also takes on the role of the bull or an adoring senorita dancing Flamenco. The tempo is brisk and measured but not fast, being about one beat per second. What truly makes this dance is the energy one puts into it and the level of dancing skill.\\nThe Paso Doble as we know it today was invented in Southern France, and Pierre Lavelle made it popular with the upper crust of Paris in the 1930s. The close proximity to Spain was undoubtedly its inspiration. Although the French copied the Spanish music and movements, they named the steps in French. The Sur Place and Huit, for example.\\nThe dance is an elaborate pantomime of a bullfight, where the matador dances proudly around, confronts his enemy (the bull) and eventually emerges victorious. Movements by the male are proud and quick, in strong defiance, while the hand and arm gestures (particularly of the female) are often graceful and fluid.\\nThis is not a dance for a crowded dance floor, as it necessarily takes up a lot of room. It is a dance to be watched and enjoyed, usually at exhibitions, performances or competitions. Youre not likely to find a knowledgeable partner standing by the wall at your local disco. It is a performance dance.\\nExperienced dancers find the Paso Doble challenging but extremely rewarding. Being theatrical in nature, it requires a great deal of showmanship, if not acting ability. Very similar to the Flamenco, it requires a haughty and confident attitude for the male.\\nThe United States first began taking notice of the dance in the 1930s, however it has never really caught on in the English-speaking countries because it is not a dance you can do without a lot of experience. For this reason, it is a great opportunity for seasoned dancers to learn something novel that will be received well by audiences.\\nA dynamic dance that requires extensive professional training, the Paso Doble is not a dance for the uninitiated. If you are a strong performer, however, few dances are as impressive or stylistic. If the conqueror is in your blood, step up to the challenge. Ole!

            "       b'Learn Foxtrot, Waltz, Paso Doble, Cha-Cha, Salsa and other ballroom & Latin dances | BallroomMagic, Vernon NJ\\nOthers\\nFoxtrot\\nThe Slow Foxtrot is a favorite among many ballroom dancers...think about the smooth dancing of Fred and Ginger. Because of its smoothness, it is often referred to as the Rolls Royce of the standard dances. Once you learn the Foxtrot, you really feel like a dancer. (The quicker version of the Foxtrot developed into the Quickstep.)\\nFoxtrot Characteristics\\nA beautiful, romantic dance, the Foxtrot is composed of fairly simple walking steps and side steps. The dance combines slow steps, which use two beats of music, and quick steps, which use one beat of music. The footwork timing is usually \"slow, quick, quick\" or \"slow, slow, quick, quick.\" The Foxtrot must be danced very smoothly, with no jerking of the body. Timing is also a very important component of the Foxtrot. As the Foxtrot is more challenging than other styles of dance, it is usually recommended to master the Waltz and Quickstep prior to attempting it.\\nSwing\\nSwing dance is a lively style of social dancing in which a dancer often lifts, spins and flips his or her partner. Considered both hip and cool, swing dancing is a favorite among social dancers of all ages. Swing Style: It\\'s not difficult to spot swing dancers...look for the couple with the biggest smiles having the most fun. Swing dance is characterized by lots of swinging, flipping and throwing of dancers. It is a non-progressive dance style because it is mostly performed in one spot, it is a popular dance for a crowded dance floor. Swing is a quick, fast-paced dance. Couples hold hands as opposed to placing hands on the shoulders or around the waist, as ballroom dancers do. Swing dancing takes a little practice, but once you learn the steps, you may never want to stop swinging.\\nSwing Dances: The term \"swing\" refers to a variety of unique partner dances.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 East Coast Swing: Seen often on club or tavern dance floors, this dance was influenced by the Foxtrot.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 West Coast Swing: A slotted dance in which the follower travels back and forth along a rectangle, or slot.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Jitterbug: An umbrella term generally referring to swing dancing.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Jive: Jive is a fast-paced variation of the Jitterbug.\\n(adapted from About.com)\\nPaso Doble\\nPaso Doble, or Pasodoble, is a lively dance modeled after the drama of the Spanish bullfight. Paso doble actually means \"two-step.\"\\nPaso Doble Characteristics\\nThe Paso Doble is a theatrical Spanish dance. Traditionally, the man is characterized as the matador (bullfighter) and the lady as his cape in the drama of a Spanish bullfight. The dancers may choose to enact the role of the torero, picador, banderillero, bull, or Spanish dancer, and may change roles throughout the dance. Based on Flamenco dancing, the Paso Doble is both arrogant and passionate. The Paso Doble is performed more as a competition dance than as a social dance.\\nPaso Doble History\\nThe Paso Doble originated in southern France and began gaining popularity in the United States in the 1930s. Because the dance developed in France, the steps of the Spanish Paso Doble actually have French names.\\nQuickstep\\nMuch like a fast version of the Foxtrot, the Quickstep is a ballroom dance style composed of extremely quick stepping and syncopated feet rhythms in time to fast-paced music. Although difficult to master and perform, the Quickstep is lots of fun to watch.\\nCharacteristics of Quickstep\\nElegant, smooth and glamorous, Quickstep dancers are energetic while appearing extremely light on their feet. It should appear that the feet of the dancers barely touch the ground. Much like the Foxtrot, dancers should strive for elegance. Upper body posture must be straight and strong throughout each movement.\\nQuickstep Action\\nThe Quickstep usually follows a 4/4 time pattern. The basic feel of the Quickstep is slow-quick-quick, slow-quick-quick, with \"slow\" taking beats one and two, and \"quick-quick\" taking beats three and four. Most of the \"slow\" steps are taken on the heel, while most \"quick\" steps are taken on the balls of the feet.\\nViennese Waltz\\nThe Viennese Waltz is the classic, original Waltz often featured in old films. The elegance and charm of the Viennese Waltz reminds us of glamorous balls in the palaces of Europe. A waltzing couple rotates around the floor, revolving gracefully around each other. The Viennese Waltz is a quick, rotating dance, much faster-paced than the classic, slow Waltz. This simplied social version is a beautiful, non-strenuous dance that dancers of all abilities can enjoy.\\nViennese Waltz Characteristics\\nThe Viennese Waltz is characterized by sweeping turns that move gracfully around the floor. This dance is known for its simple and elegant rotational movement.\\nWaltz\\nThe romantic Waltz is one of the most popular ballroom dances of all time. Considered by some as the \"mother of present day dances\" and the \"backbone dance\" of the ballroom, the Waltz is the basis for many dances. Developed in Germany, the Waltz is popular all over the world. A truly romantic dance, the Waltz is comprised of soft, round, flowing movements.\\nWaltz Characteristics\\nThe Waltz is a smooth dance that travels around the line of dance. Characterized by its \"rise and fall\" action, the Waltz includes a step, slide, and step in 3/4 time. Dancers should move their shoulders smoothly, parallel with the floor instead of up and down. Dancers must strive to lengthen each step. On the first beat of the music, a step is taken forward on the heel, then onto the ball of the foot with a gradual rise to the toes, continuing on to the second and third beats of the music. At the end of the third beat, the heel is lowered to the floor to the starting position.\\nSource: About.com Guide\\nCha-Cha\\nhe Cha Cha is one of the most popular of the social Latin-American dances. Lively and flirtatious, the Cha Cha is full of passion and energy.\\nCha Cha Characteristics\\nThe Cha Cha is a vibrant, flamboyant and playful dance. The light and bubbly feel of the Cha Cha gives it a unique sense of fun for dancers throughout the world. The Cha Cha requires small steps and lots of hip motion (Cuban motion), as it is danced in 4/4 time. The fourth beat is split into two, giving it the characteristic 2,3,4 & 1 rhythm. Therefore, five steps are danced to four beats as in the \"One, two, cha cha cha\" rhythm.\\nHistory of the Cha Cha\\nAlso called the Cha Cha Cha, this unmistakable dance originated in Cuba in the 1940s. Composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin developed the dance as a variant of the Mambo and Rumba. The name is onomatopoeic, derived from the sound of dancers\\' shoes as they shuffled around the floor.\\nJive\\nJive is one of the five International Latin dances. A lively, and uninhibited variation of Jitterbug, many of its basic patterns are similar to those of East Coast Swing.\\nCharacteristics of Jive\\nJive and East Coast Swing share many figures, as well as the same music style and tempo. The basic look and feel of Jive is lots and lots of energy, with the legs portraying a pumping action. Both the East Coast Swing and basic Jive consist of two triple steps and a rock step. The Jive differs in that the count begins with the rock step, which is counted \"1,2.\" The two triple steps are counted \"3 and 4\" and \"5 and 6.\"\\nHistory of Jive\\nOriginating in the United States in the 1940s, Jive was influenced by the Boogie, Rock & Roll, African/American Swing and Lindyhop.\\nSalsa\\nSalsa is a popular social dance throughout Latin America as well as in North America, Europe, Australia, and some countries in Asia and the Middle East. Salsa dance movements originate from the Cuban Son dancing of the 1940s more specifically through the beat of Son Montuno with strong influences from the dance of Danzon, Mambo, Guaguanco and other Afro-Cuban folkloric dancing.\\nToday there are many various styles of salsa dancing because of geographical dispersion and cultural syncretism. Some of the most common styles are: LA-style, New York-style, and Miami-style.\\nMiami-style Casino Developed by Cuban migrants to Florida and centered around Miami, this form of Cuban Salsa fused with American culture and LA Style. Major differences of Miami-style Casino is that it is exclusive dance to downbeat (On1) and has elements of shines and show style added to it following repertoires of North American Styles.\\nLos Angeles style L.A. style is danced on 1, in a slot, with a measure of easiness and adaptability to it. It is strongly influenced by the Mambo, Swing, Argentine Tango and Latin Ballroom dancing styles. L.A. style places strong emphasis on sensuousness, theatricality, aerobics and musicality. The two essential elements of this dance are the forward\\xe2\\x80\\x93backward basic and the cross-body lead.\\nNew York style Like LA-style salsa, New York style is danced in a slot. However, unlike LA style, it is danced on the second beat of the music (\"on 2\"), and the follower steps forward on the first measure of the music, not the leader. Though he did not create New York style salsa, Eddie Torres is credited with popularizing it, and for having the follower step forward on the first beat. New York style salsa emphasizes harmony with the percussive instruments in salsa music, such as the congas, timbales, and clave, since many or all of those instruments often mark the second beat in the music. (adapted from Wikipedia.com)\\nMambo\\nOriginally from Cuba, the Mambo is enjoyed throughout the world at both the social and competitive dance levels. The mambo is a favorite of ballroom audiences because of its high energy level and infectious rhythms. Popularized in recent years by singers such as Ricky Martin, the Mambo is fascinating and diverse.\\nMambo Characteristics\\nThe feel of the Mambo is based mostly on forward and backward movements. The basic components of the dance include rock steps and side steps, with occasional points, kicks and flicks of the feet. Important to Mambo is the distinctive hip movement, hence the meaning of the word mambo: \"shake it.\"\\nMambo Action\\nSome say the Mambo is a flirtacious, sensual dance, sometimes almost raunchy. Mambo dancers appear quite passionate and seem to express that passion with the movements of their hips. Exaggerated hip movements combined with long, flowing movements and sharp, quick steps contribute to the sensuous feel of the Mambo.\\nRumba\\nThe Rumba is a dance that tells a story of love and passion between a strong, male lover and a coy, teasing woman. Full of sensual movements, the Rumba is considered by many to be the sexiest of the ballroom dances. \"Rumba\" is a term that refers to a variety of dances or a \"dance party.\" This dance of love is one of the most popular ballroom dances and is seen around the world at nightclubs, parties, weddings and dance competitions.\\nRumba Characteristics\\nThe Rumba is a very slow, serious, romantic dance with flirtation between the partners. The dance is fun to watch, as many of its basic dance figures of the dance have a teasing theme in which the lady flirts with and then rejects her male partner, often with apparent sexual aggression. The Rumba spotlights the lady\\'s rhythmic body movements and hip actions resulting in intense, almost steamy, scenes of passion.\\nHistory of Rumba\\nThe rumba is often referred to as the \"grandfather of the Latin dances.\" Originating in Cuba, it first came to the United States in the early 1920s. The Rumba is the slowest of the five competition Latin and American dances.\\nSamba\\nDeveloped in Brazil during the 19th century, the Samba is considered the dance of celebration and joy at Carnival celebrations in Rio. Lively and rhythmical, there are many types of Samba dances, just like there are many types of Samba music. Ballroom partner Samba, one of the popular Latin dances in ballroom competitions, is made up of many different South American dances mixed into one. In Brazil, a Samba dancer is known as a Sambista.\\nSamba Characteristics\\nBefore Samba became a ballroom dance style, there were many styles of partner dances as well as solo Samba dances. As with the solo Samba, partner ballroom Samba has a quick beat that requires fast footwork. Over the years, the Samba has incorporated elaborate tricks, turns, and acrobatic feats into its basic set of figures. The main characteristics of the Samba are rapid steps taken on quarter beats and a rocking, swaying motion of the dancers.\\nTango\\nOne of the most fascinating of all dances, the tango is a sensual ballroom dance that originated in South America in the early twentieth century. Tango is usually performed by a man and a woman, expressing an element of romance in their synchronized movements. Originally, the tango was performed only by women, but once it spread into Argentina, it developed into a dance for couples. The popularity of the tango has greatly increased over the years. Argentine Tango is much more intimate than Modern Tango, and is well-suited to dancing in small settings. Argentine Tango retains the intimacy of the original dance.\\nTango Styles:\\nSeveral different styles of tango exist, each with its own individual flair. Most of the styles are danced in either open embrace, with the couple having space between their bodies, or in close embrace, where the couple is closely connected at either the chest or the hip area. Many people are familiar with \"ballroom tango,\" characterized by strong, dramatic head snaps.\\nTango Techniques:\\nTango is danced to a repetitive style of music. The count of the music is either 16 or 32 beats. While dancing the tango, the lady is held in the crook of the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm. She holds her head back and rests her right hand on the man\\'s lower hip. The man must allow the lady to rest in this position while leading her around the floor in a curving pattern. Tango dancers must strive to make a strong connection with the music as well as their audience.\\nSource: About.com Guide\\nOther Dances',\n",

During the 18th century it was incorporated to comedies and was adopted as a regulatory step for the Spanish infantry, with a special feature that makes the troops take the regular step: 120 steps per minute. The music was introduced in bullfights during the 19th century. It is played during the bullfighters\\' entrance to the ring (paseo) or during the passes (faena) just before the kill. It corresponds to the pasodoble dance (traditional and ballroom ).\\nPaso Doble is a lively style of dance to the duple meter march -like pasodoble music. It is modelled after the sound, drama, and movement of the Spanish and Portuguese bullfight . The traditional version as couple\\'s dance originated in France, and was then adopted in Spain and Portugal. Its original form as a Spanish military march is still interpreted nowadays in the context of the Moor and Christian festivals, in the southeast region of Spain, being the major focus of current pasodoble productions.\\nFamous bullfighters have been honoured with pasodoble tunes named after them. Other tunes have been inspired by patriotic motifs or local characters.\\nContents\\nLa Virgen de la Macarena\\nPasodoble hace salir el sol (The Pasodoble makes the sun come up)\\nMexican pasodobles\\nEl Piti, El Charro C\\xc3\\xa1rdenas, El 11-81, San Antonio de Triana, Fermincito, Lorenzo Garza, El abuelito, El banderillero, Mar\\xc3\\xada Caball\\xc3\\xa9, El Berrendito de San Juan, Tarde de toros, Por tapat\\xc3\\xadas, Toros en San Miguel, Rodolfo Gaona, Joselito Huerta, Toros de Llaguno, La Macarenita.\\nBy Agust\\xc3\\xadn Lara : Silverio P\\xc3\\xa9rez, El Novillero, Ferm\\xc3\\xadn.\\nDance\\nTraditional\\nAmparito Roca being played by a wind band\\nPasodoble is based on music played at bullfights during the bullfighters\\' entrance (paseo) or during the passes (faena) just before the kill. The leader of this dance plays the part of the matador . The follower generally plays the part of the matador\\'s cape, but can also represent the shadow of the matador, as well as the flamenco dancer in some figures. The follower never represents the bull, althrough it is commonly thought this way. Its origin dates back to a French military march with the name \"Paso Redoble.\" This was a fast paced march, which is why this is a fast-paced Latin American dance modeled after the Spanish bullfight. Bullfighting was well known around this time.\\nBallroom\\nA significant number of pasodoble songs are variations of Espa\\xc3\\xb1a Ca\\xc3\\xb1i . The song has breaks or \"highlights\" in fixed positions in the song (two highlights at syllabus levels,[ clarification needed ] three highlights and a longer song at Open levels). Highlights emphasize music and are more powerful sounding than other parts of the music, usually, dancers have decoration trick and then the position that is to be held to the end of the highlight. Traditionally pasodoble routines are choreographed to match these highlights, as well as the musical phrases . Accordingly, most other ballroom pasodoble tunes are written with similar highlights (those without are simply avoided in most competitions).\\nBecause of its inherently choreographed tradition, ballroom pasodoble for the most part is danced only competitively, almost never socially, or without previously learned routine. This said, in Spain , France , Vietnam , Colombia , Costa Rica and some parts of Germany it is danced socially as a lead (not choreographed) dance. In Venezuela , pasodoble is almost a must-have dance in weddings and big parties, being especially famous by the song \"Guitarra Espa\\xc3\\xb1ola\" by Los Mel\\xc3\\xb3dicos.\\nIn competitive dance, modern pasodoble is combined with other four dances ( samba , cha-cha-cha , rumba and jive ) under the banner International Latin . Modern pasodoble dance consists of two dancing parts and one break in between for dancers of class D and of three parts and two breaks in between for dancers of class C, B, A, according to the IDSF classification. [2] Dancers of lower than D-class usually perform only four official dances of Latin-American Program.\\nPasedoble Galaball2011',\n",

            "       b'Just Dance Ballroom :: Dance Styles\\nWaltz\\nThere are two main styles of ballroom dancing -- American and                 International. American style is danced primarily in the USA.                 It\\'s also not as standardized as International style, which is                 danced and known worldwide. Here in the USA, American style is                 practiced more for social dancing while International style is                 primarily seen in competitions. People will dance either American                 or International style socially, and competitions may include                 both styles.\\nThere are two categories: In American style, the categories                 are called Smooth and Rhythm and in International style they                 are called Standard and Latin. For the most part, the Standard                 and Smooth categories contain the same dances and the Latin and                 Rhythm categories contain basically the same dances. These are                 listed in the order that they are danced in competitions.\\nAmerican Style\\nStandard -- Waltz, Tango, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot , Quickstep\\nLatin -- Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso Doble, Jive\\nThere are also other social styles of dances that are not \\xe2\\x80\\x98strictly                 ballroom\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but rather \"fun\" although \"non-traditional.\" They include                 the hustle, salsa, merengue, west coast swing, Argentine tango,                 lindy and Hip Hop.\\nThe five most popular Ballroom dances in the world are Foxtrot,                 Waltz, Rumba, Cha Cha, and Swing. Dancers skilled in these five                 dances can dance with partners from any part of the world.\\nTo distinguish between International and American styles, look                 for two points: the dance position used is probably the easiest                 way to tell apart the Standard and Smooth dances. International                 Standard is danced almost exclusively in closed dance positions                 while American Smooth allows more open work where the partners                 can separate from each other and dance in open positions.\\nThe Latin and Rhythm dances tend to be a bit harder to tell                 apart. The dancers\\' leg action is probably the best clue as to                 which style they\\'re dancing. In American Rhythm, the dancers                 will use a bent leg action allowing them to delay their change                 of weight on the step, so you will frequently see them with bent                 legs. However, in International Latin, the dancers usually have                 the look of two straight legs which comes from the faster change                 of weight on the step.\\nThere are also many fusion dances that combine the elements                 of two or more dance styles into a new dance. These new dances                 are springing up primarily in metropolitan areas where the dance                 populations are large, vibrant and hungry for creative opportunities                 within the specific social dance communities to which they belong.\\nFoxtantino is                 a new fusion dance that connects the American and International                 styles of Foxtrot to Argentine Tango. This dance was designed                 specifically for the Ballroom community. It uses the teaching                 methods, technique and language of the ballroom dances so Foxtantino                 is easy for Ballroom dancers to learn and dance with each other.                 Ballroom dancers are intrigued and fascinated with Argentine                 Tango, but, many do not want to give up their dance frame, their                 Ballroom culture and/or acquire new music appreciation skills                 and fully enter into the Argentine Tango community. Foxtantino                 provides Ballroom dancers the fun and excitement of Argentine                 Tango while keeping to the style of dancing with which they are                 familiar.\\nARGENTINE                 TANGO\\nThe Tango originated in Buenos Aires during the late 19th Century                 and began as one of many different forms of tango dances. Modern                 Argentine Tango styles are danced both in open (Tango Nuevo)                 and closed embraces (traditional) that focus on the leader and                 the follower moving in harmony with the passionately charged                 music. The dance relies on improvisation by the leader since                 Argentine Tango doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a formal basic structure like                 other dances. Fortunately for learning purposes, teachers have                 fashioned a basic form in order to teach beginners.\\nThe tango is essentially walking with a partner to music keeping                 your feet close to the floor as you move with your ankles and                 knees brushing as one leg passes the other. Argentine Tango is                 different from ballroom tangos in its posture, embrace, improvisational                 techniques, movement, balance, steps and music. If your background                 is in American or International tango, your introduction to Argentine                 tango will be like learning a completely new dance.\\nTop | Calendar\\nAMERICAN TANGO\\nThe American tango is a descendent of the original tango from                 Argentina and continues to evolve. Among those influences, the                 technical International (English) style Tango, the dramatic Paso                 Doble, and even the original Argentine style continue to contribute                 to its evolution. But American is still best known as both the                 simplest and the showiest of all Tangos.\\nFootwork: In Tango the feet pick up and place onto the floor,                   rather than gliding along in constant contact with the floor.                   The foot action is highly articulated, often being compared                   to the sneaking or stalking action of a cat. Forward walks                   are placed with the heel first, then flat. Backward walks are                   taken with a toe first, with the heel lowering as the body                   moves over it. At the same time, the toe of the forward foot                   should release from the floor as the body moves away. Side                   steps and chasses normally use a whole foot or ball-flat action.\\nRise & Fall: There is no rise & fall action in Tango.                   The body level should remain constant throughout.\\nContra Body Movement: Forward walks normally curve gradually                   to the left, therefore the left foot forward walk is taken                   with CBM, while the right foot forward walk is taken with a                   right side leading. Backward walks also normally curve gradually                   to the left, therefore the right foot backward walk is taken                   with CBM, while the left foot backward walk is taken with a                   left side leading.\\nTango uses a modified dance hold, more compact than the normal                 closed position ballroom hold. The man and lady stand slightly                 farther offset, causing the man\\'s right arm to be positioned                 farther around the lady\\'s back so that the fingers of his right                 hand lay across her spine. Instead of placing her left arm on                 top of his, she will hook her forearm underneath his elbow and                 upper arm. Her wrist will be positioned directly underneath his                 arm (possibly, but not necessarily in contact) with palm facing                 inward, her fingers just reaching his torso. The lady\\'s right                 hand and man\\'s left hand are joined in an upper-hand clasp at                 approximately the lady\\'s eye level. The man\\'s left and lady\\'s                 right elbow may be held slightly higher than normal, with a more                 acute angle at the elbow.\\nTop | Calendar\\nCHA-CHA\\nOriginally called the Cha-cha-cha, this dance evolved from the                 Mambo and the Rumba on Cuban dance floors in the 1950\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.                 It is danced to Latin music with strong African and Cuban rhythms.                 The Cha-cha has a 4/4 syncopation where 5 steps are danced in                 4 beats of music. Its unmistakable counting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone, two,                 cha-cha-cha\\xe2\\x80\\x9d requires that the dancers use small steps.                 The Cha-cha is a very flirtatious dance filled with a catch-me-if-you-can                 attitude between partners. Hip movements and bending and straightening                 of the knees give the Cha-cha the classic Cuban motion. Partners                 work together to synchronize their movements in perfect parallel                 alignment.\\nTop | Calendar\\nBolero\\nBolero is a 3/4 dance smooth, sophisticated, sentimental ballroom                 dance that originated in Spain in the late 18th century. The                 emphasis is on smoothness, grace and communication between partners.                 Bolero has the same Afro-Cuban roots as the Rumba and is thought                 to have originated in Cuba. The music is frequently Spanish vocals                 with a subtle percussion effect. The dance is itself a slow salsa,                 with a taste of Tango and has easy patterns. The Bolero is a                 modification of the Fandango. The original dance was invented                 in about 1780 by Sebastian Cerezo a celebrated dancer from Cadiz,                 Spain. It was danced singly or in couples, the dancers exhibiting                 complex and intricate movements while maintaining the rattle                 of their castanets. The dance should tell the story of a couple                 falling in love. The partners change from a very close hold to                 solo dancing, and then come together as one.\\nThe American Style Bolero is a unique dance style combining                 the patterns of Rumba with the rise and fall technique and character                 of Waltz and Foxtrot. The music is 4/4 time, and is danced to                 the slowest rhythms of the Latin ballroom dances (the spectrum                 runs Bolero, Rumba, Cha Cha, Mambo). The basic rhythm of steps                 in patterns, like Rumba, is Slow-Quick-Quick.\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\nFoxtrot\\nThe Foxtrot is truly an American dance, credited to Harry Fox                 and dating back to 1914 when he was reportedly doing rapid trotting                 steps with his partner to Ragtime music (the original form of                 Jazz), and it was originally referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s                 Trot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Since those early vaudeville days both the music                 and the dance have changed into the more smooth and sauntering                 dance that we see today. Foxtrot is the classic social Ballroom                 dance- In most old movies when you see a large crowd dancing                 close with their partners to a big band, they are doing Foxtrot.\\nFoxtrot is danced to jazz or Big Band music, the same style                 of music that you would dance swing to. Speed is usually the                 deciding factor that makes a song better for Foxtrot (danced                 with a 4/4 rhythm and 110-150 beats/minute tempo) or for Swing                 (danced to 120-250 beats per minute), but you can usually dance                 a slow swing to any Foxtrot tune. In fact it is fun and not too                 difficult to go back and forth between Swing and Foxtrot in the                 same dance.\\nFoxtrot is danced in a closed position (facing your partner                 and holding them close). The walking steps are taken as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cslows\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2                 beats per step) or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquicks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d(1 beat per step), with                 the most common Foxtrot rhythms being SQQ, SQQ or SSQQ, but ultimately                 the dancers may use whatever rhythm that they choose, which allows                 them to change their dance to fit the music.\\nMany people mistakenly think that Foxtrot is a difficult dance                 to learn , but this is usually because they are thinking of more                 complicated styles of Foxtrot such as International Style and                 American Silver and Gold Styles, that are used mainly in performances                 and competitions. Basic social Foxtrot (sometimes referred to                 as American Bronze Style) is fun and simple to learn, an excellent                 dance for beginners.\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\nFoxtantino\\nFoxtantino is a new fusion dance that                 connects the Ballroom American and International styles of Foxtrot                 to Argentine Tango. This dance was designed specifically for                 the Ballroom community. It uses the teaching methods, technique                 and language of the ballroom dances so Foxtantino is easy for                 Ballroom dancers to learn and dance with each other. Ballroom                 dancers are intrigued and fascinated with Argentine Tango, but,                 many do not want to give up their dance frame, their Ballroom                 culture and/or acquire new music appreciation skills and fully                 enter into the Argentine Tango community. Foxtantino provides                 Ballroom dancers the fun and excitement of Argentine Tango while                 keeping to the style of dancing with which they are familiar.

Funk is fast, powerful and                 passionate. People like James Brown, Hammer and Michael Jackson                 have this style. It is what you would see if you were to attend                 a house party in Oakland. Funk is what you do at parties. Hip                 Hop is slower with a lot of posing. It mixes modern dance and                 jazz moves. This makes it more assessable and commercial. This                 is what you see in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music videos. Many dances, such                 as Funk, Hip Hop, Boogaloo and Krunk originated in the Black                 Urban World. Many of the best dancers are not on television and                 would not be selected for a music video, but their moves are                 used all the time.

It has lots of open traveling movements,                   spins and syncopations and is danced to, disco and house music                   with a pulsing beat.. The Hustle is often peppered with showy                   moves that competitive dancers weaved into their repertoire                   throughout the late 1970\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x99s; as it continued                   to evolve, Hustle began to borrow from other dance styles.                   These included Smooth Ballroom, from which it took traveling                   movements and pivots, as well as other partner dance forms                   such as Swing, the Latin Rhythm dances, Martial arts, Gymnastics,                   Ballet training, and good old fashioned attitude making for                   crowd pleasing performance. Hustle combined dance patterns                   and movements that influenced the way that most partner dances                   are performed today.\\nEven today the dance continues to evolve, yet it has                   never lost its basic count since the mid-1970\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of \\xe2\\x80\\x9c&1-2-3\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.                   The Hustle is the last authentic American partner dance born                   and cultivated here in the United States.\\nTop | Calendar\\nJIVE\\nJive is a dance style that originated among African Americans                 in the early 1940s. It is a lively and uninhibited variation                 of the Jitterbug that belongs to the Swing dance group. Modern                 Jive, sometimes called French Jive is a dance style that originated                 in the 1980s. It derives from Swing, Lindy Hop and may include                 Rock \\'n\\' Roll and others, the main innovation being simplification                 of footwork. Moves from many forms of ballroom dance including                 Salsa and Tango may also be included.\\nModern Jive is generally danced to music with 4 beats to the                 bar from latest chart hits to Big Band music. Some styles may                 concentrate on particular musical styles, such as swing. Modern                 Jive is a male led dance but women are encouraged to ask men                 to dance.\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\nNightclub Two-Step\\nThe Night Club Two Step is an easy dance with a characteristic                 rock step followed by a side step, which is actually a 5th position                 break. The dance has 8 beats and rarely changes from the 1 & 2                 count. The tempo is 30-34 bars per minute and is often done to                 medium tempo music.\\nNot to be confused with country two step, this club-style Two                 Step dance style features a swaying lilt. It was created and                 popularized by California dance teacher Buddy Schwimmer more                 than 30 years ago when he was only 15.\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\nMERENGUE\\nMerengue is mainly a club dance set to fast Latin music. It                 is characterized by dramatically swinging hips and a closed hold                 position. The couple steps side to side in sets of 8 to 2/4 music,                 turning clockwise or counterclockwise and features a characteristic                 hip swing and graceful arm flourishes. It is the national dance                 of the Dominican Republic and there are a number of popular versions                 as to the origin of this dance. One story claims the dance originated                 with slaves who were chained together, and, of necessity, were                 forced to drag one leg as they cut sugar cane to the beat of                 a drum.\\nThe second story maintains that a great hero was wounded in                 the leg during one of the many insurrections in the Dominican                 Republic. A party of villagers welcomed him home with a victory                 celebration and out of sympathy everyone dancing felt obliged                 to limp and drag one foot. The Dominicans themselves maintain                 Merengue is a combination of two dances, one African and the                 other the French Minuet, from the late 1700\\'s - to early 1800s.The                 Black slaves saw the ballroom dancing in the Big Houses and when                 they had their own festivities started mimicking the \"masters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dances\".                 But the European dances were uninteresting so the slaves added                 a special upbeat (provided by the drums), which was a slight                 skip or a hop.\\nThe original Merengue was not danced by individual couples,                 but was a circle dance, men and women faced each other, holding                 hands at arms\\' length. They did not hold each other closely and                 the original movements of this dance were only the shaking of                 the shoulders and swift movements of the feet. There was no blatant                 movement as there is today as ethnic African dances do not move                 the hips. In fact, African dances consisted of complicated steps                 and arm movements. Ethnic dance does not have sexual shaking                 of the hips this is only done in Hollywood movies. Not only is                 it performed on every dancing occasion in the Republic, but it                 is very popular throughout the Caribbean and South America. A                 lot of variety exists in Merengue music. Ideally suited to small,                 crowded dance floors, it is a dance that is easy to learn and                 very enjoyable to perform.\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\nPASO DOBLE\\nPaso Doble originated in France, but is reminiscent of the sound,                 dramas and movement of the Spanish bullfight. Paso Doble means \"two                 step\" in Spanish. It is a dance for the Man, which allows                 him to fill the \"stage\" with strong three-dimensional                 shapes and movements danced with \"Pride and Dignity\".\\nThe woman\\'s role varies depending on the interpretation of the                 dance. The woman can take the role of the matador\\'s cape, the                 bull or even the matador at different times within the dance.                 Characteristics of the Paso Doble are the \"marching\" flavor                 given to the steps and the cape movements creating tension between                 both dancers.\\nThe CHASSEZ CAPE is when the man uses the woman as the cape                 in order to turn her around. APEL is when the man stamps his                 foot as if trying to attract the bulls\\' attention. During the                 dance the use of castanets is simulated. The ARPEL is a commencement                 of a movement with the stamping of the feet where the man and                 woman walk in different directions.\\nBecause of its inherently choreographed tradition, ballroom                 Paso Doble for the most part is usually only danced competitively,                 almost never socially \\xe2\\x80\\x93 unless there is a previously learned                 routine.\\nTop | Calendar\\nQuickstep\\nThe Quick step is a descendent of the Boston and the One Step                 which appeared on the scene with the arrival of Ragtime and Jazz                 music in America towards the end of the nineteenth century. These                 two were the first dances based on the forward step. They used                 a heel lead followed by two or more steps on the balls of the                 feet.\\nIt was first performed on stage in New York in 1922 in a black revue by George White, and then in the stage show \"Running                 Wild\" in 1923 by the Ziegfeld Follies, which toured U.S.A.                 It was popularized in Europe by Josephine Baker in Paris in the                 1920\\'s. It was danced with wild swinging arms and side kicks                 to music at 200 to 240 beats per minute. It subsequently became                 very popular worldwide, but the wild character of the dance induced                 many sedate ballrooms either to ban it altogether, or to put                 up notices saying simply \"PCQ\", standing for \"Please                 Charleston Quietly\".\\nThe Black Bottom and the Shimmy became very popular in the USA                 between 1910 to 1920, and became a national craze after being                 performed in the Ziegfeld Follies in 1922. These dances became                 absorbed into a faster version of Foxtrot after a visit by Paul                 Whiteman\\'s band to the UK in 1923, becoming known as the Quickstep.\\nThe Quickstep was developed to interpret music with a faster                 tempo. It is a fast moving dance based on walks and Chasses danced                 to music of four beats per bar at 50 bars per minute, or 200                 beats per minute. It retains the walks, runs, chasses and turns,                 of the original Foxtrot, with some other fast figures such as                 locks, hops, and skips added.\\nTop | Calendar\\nRumba\\nThe Rumba, widely considered the most romantic and sensual of                 the Latin dances, has a magnetic interplay between its partners.                 Sometimes called the Grandfather of the Latin dances, the Rumba                 made its way from Cuba to the United States in the early 1920\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.                 Rumba music is in 4/4 time and there are four beats in each measure.                 Two measures of music are required for a full basic step. In                 four beats of music, three steps are taken. Essential to Rumba                 is the Cuban motion achieved through knee-straightening, figure-eight                 hip rolls and swiveling action of the feet. Strong and direct                 walks lead by the ball of the foot are also characteristic of                 the Rumba.\\nTop | Calendar\\nSamba\\nSamba is a lively, rhythmical dance of Brazilian                 origin in 2/4 time danced under the Samba music. However, there                 are three steps to every bar, making the Samba feel like a 3/4                 timed dance. There are two major streams of Samba dance that                 differ significantly: the modern Ballroom Samba, and the traditional                 Brazilian Samba. Rio de Janeiro is the type of Samba seen in                 Brazilian Carnival parades.\\nThe ballroom Samba is danced to music in 2/4 or 4/4 time. The                 basic movements are counted either 1-2 or 1-a-2, and are danced                 with a slight downward bouncing or dropping action. This action                 is created through the bending and straightening of the knees,                 with bending occurring on the beats of 1 and 2, and the straightening                 occurring on the \"a\".\\nAs a ballroom dance, the samba is a partner dance. Ballroom                 samba, like other ballroom dances, is very disconnected from                 the origins and evolution of the music and dance that gives it                 its name. It is a form created for its suitability as a partner                 dance. The dance movements, which do not change depending on                 the style of samba music being played, borrows some movements                 from Afro-Brazilian traditional dances.\\nTop | Calendar\\nSalsa\\nSalsa is not easily defined. Who invented salsa? The Cubans,                 Puerto Ricans? Salsa is a distillation of many Latin and Afro-Caribbean                 dances. Each played a large part in its evolution.\\nSalsa is similar to Mambo in that both have a pattern of six                 steps danced over eight counts of music. The dances share many                 of the same moves. In Salsa, turns have become an important feature,                 so the overall look and feels are quite different form those                 of Mambo. Mambo moves generally forward and backward, whereas,                 Salsa has more of a side to side feel.\\nTop | Calendar\\nEast Coast Swing\\nSwing music has an infectious accent on the upbeat and makes                 even non-dancers tap their feet, and snap their fingers. The                 most elemental definition of Swing dancing is any style of dancing                 to Swing music, and there are hundreds of styles. Swing dancing                 is usually characterized by its bounce and energy as well as                 lots of spins or under arm turns.\\nThe original                 style of Swing dancing is the Lindy Hop which was named by Shorty                 George Snowden in 1927 after Charles Lindberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famed nonstop                 flight across the Atlantic.\\nKnown by many for its acrobatic moves called arials, Lindy Hop                 is also danced socially featuring 8 count and 6 count patterns,                 often with kicking or Charleston steps. Examples of Lindy Hop                 can be seen in recent movies such as Malcolm X or Swing Kids,                 or older movies like A Day at the Races or Hellzapoppin. There                 are many different definitions and styles, but when most people                 refer to basic swing dancing, they are referring to a simplified                 version of the original Lindy Hop, favoring 6 count moves and                 also referred to as 6- count swing, east coast swing, jitterbug,                 and Lindy.\\nSix-count swing can be danced to jazz or big band music from                 speeds of 110 beats per minute to 300 beats per minute, but most                 people enjoy dancing to the 120-180 beat per minute range. The                 6 count basic can be modified in many ways, but is most common                 as rock-step, triple-step, triple-step (often referred to as                 triple time or triple step swing) or rock-step, step, step (often                 referred to as single step or single time swing). 6 count swing                 is easy to learn, especially when done with the single step rhythm.                 The triple step rhythm is better suited for slower songs, and                 can be substituted for the single step once you are comfortable                 with the steps. Swing music and dancing are two of the most important                 cultural imports of America, learning how to dance can be a great                 way to connect with a part of our history.\\nTop | Calendar\\nWest Coast Swing\\nWest Coast Swing is a smooth and sexy dance style that is danced                 in a slot (a narrow line), making it perfect for a crowded dance                 floor. West Coast Swing is danced to a variety of music, including                 rock, blues, funk, country/western, disco and contemporary pop.                 West Coast Swing also stresses leader-follower connection and                 dancing in close harmony with the music.\\nBasically, West Coast Swing consists of 6-beat and 8-beat patterns                 executed in a                 slot area on the dance floor, and can be danced to a variety                 of styles of music. It has enjoyed a rise in popularity in the                 last few years, due partly to the work of the U.S. Open Swing                 Dance Championships.\\nTop | Calendar\\nWaltz\\nThe introduction of the Waltz was the scandal of 19th century                 English society. Never before had a man and woman danced publicly                 in a virtual embrace. Fortunately the grace and beauty of the                 Waltz were noticed, and English society, so quick to denounce                 the dance, eventually \"embraced\" it. In fact, Queen                 Victoria was an exquisite ballroom dancer who developed a passion                 for the Waltz. Johann Strauss can be credited with the persistence                 of the Waltz in mainstream ballroom dancing with his fast paced                 Waltz compositions that paved the way for the quicker Viennese                 style. In America the Waltz tempo slowed to form a more smooth                 and graceful gliding dance with a gentle \"rise and fall\" motion.                 Today the Waltz persists as the oldest of ballroom dances and                 perhaps the best loved. The Waltz is unique in that it is the                 only ballroom dance written in 3/4 time. There are three beats                 to each measure, counted as \"1-2-3\" or \"quick-quick-quick.\" Typically,                 there are three steps of equal duration per measure, with the                 Hesitation being the exception. The lead foot alternates with                 each measure (i.e., Left-2-3-Right-2-3). Because of this, Waltz                 combinations are usually written in a series of six steps.\\nOne of the most distinguishing features of the Waltz is the                 3/4 time signature that it is played in. This means that each                 measure has 3 beats rather than the more common 2 or 4. Waltz                 is counted 1-2-3 with a heavy accent on the 1. You can not dance                 other dances such as foxtrot, swing, or tango to waltz music                 because of this three beat grouping. Graceful turning moves are                 very characteristic of the Waltz.\\nToday, the Waltz is most commonly danced in the Viennese, country                 or ballroom style. Viennese originates from England and is danced                 mostly in competitions by more advanced dancers, while American                 Style is more suitable to beginners and those who want to dance                 Waltz socially. A beginner dancer should start with country or                 American style Waltz. Viennese Waltz is danced very fast and                 is characterized by an almost nonstop turning and is one of the                 most difficult forms of Waltz to learn. Country and ballroom                 styles of Waltz are very similar, with the country style danced                 at a slightly faster pace and incorporating more moves in open                 and side-by-side positions. Ballroom Waltz can be divided into                 American and International Styles. International Style as LRL (left-right-left) and the second as RLR (right-left-right), for                 a total of six steps.\\nTop | Calendar\\nViennese Waltz\\nThe Waltz is a dance performed to music with three beats to                 the bar, and gives the dance a delightful romantic lift.\\nThe first record of a dance to 3/4 rhythm is a peasant dance                 of the Provence area of France in 1559, as a piece of folk music                 called the Volta, although the Volta has also been claimed to                 be an Italian folk dance at this time. The word \"Volta\" means \"the                 turn\" in Italian. This, even in its earliest days, the                 dance appears to have involved the couple turning as they danced.\\nDuring the 16th Century, the Volta became popular in the royal                 courts of Western Europe. The Volta required the partners to                 dance in a closed position but with the lady to the left of the                 man! As in any turning dance, as the couple perform their step                 around their partner, they have to take a larger than usual step                 to get from one side of their partner to the other. In order                 to do this in the Volta, the partners had to hold each other                 in such a close embrace that many declared it immoral. Louis                 XIII (1610-1613) had it banned from court on this account.\\nThus although the Volta may have originally been in 3 time,                 it evolved to be in 5 time. In 1754 the first music for the actual \"Waltzen\" appeared                 in Germany. Any connection between the Waltzen and the Volta                 remains obscure, except that the word \"waltzen\" in                 German also means \"to revolve\".\\nThe dance became very popular in Vienna, with large dance halls                 being opened to accommodate the craze. In 1812 the dance was                 introduced into England under the name of the German Waltz and                 it caused a great sensation. Through the 19th Century, the danced                 stabilized, and was further popularized by the music of Josef                 and Johann Strauss.\\nCurrently, the Viennese Waltz is danced at a tempo of about                 180 beats per minute, with a limited range of figures: change                 steps, hesitations, hovers, passing changes, natural and reverse                 turns, (traveling or on the spot as Fleckers), and the contra                 check.'],\n",

Witness the Paso Doble. Meaning double step in Spanish, this ballroom dance for couples is set to Spanish march music that is reminiscent of a bullfight in the heart of Spain.\\nIt is the same style of music that is played when a bullfighter enters the ring to salute the audience before the fight, and again at the end of the fight, just before the kill. This assumes, of course, that the bull doesnt win the fight.\\nThe dance is lively and dramatic, with long sweeping steps and aggressive movements. It is a dance of preparation for battle and triumph in combat, just like the bullfights that inspired it. The male represents the matador, boldly and proudly entering the ring. The female represents the matadors cape, which he whips around with graceful elegance. The female also takes on the role of the bull or an adoring senorita dancing Flamenco. The tempo is brisk and measured but not fast, being about one beat per second. What truly makes this dance is the energy one puts into it and the level of dancing skill.\\nThe Paso Doble as we know it today was invented in Southern France, and Pierre Lavelle made it popular with the upper crust of Paris in the 1930s. The close proximity to Spain was undoubtedly its inspiration. Although the French copied the Spanish music and movements, they named the steps in French. The Sur Place and Huit, for example.\\nThe dance is an elaborate pantomime of a bullfight, where the matador dances proudly around, confronts his enemy (the bull) and eventually emerges victorious. Movements by the male are proud and quick, in strong defiance, while the hand and arm gestures (particularly of the female) are often graceful and fluid.\\nThis is not a dance for a crowded dance floor, as it necessarily takes up a lot of room. It is a dance to be watched and enjoyed, usually at exhibitions, performances or competitions. Youre not likely to find a knowledgeable partner standing by the wall at your local disco. It is a performance dance.\\nExperienced dancers find the Paso Doble challenging but extremely rewarding. Being theatrical in nature, it requires a great deal of showmanship, if not acting ability. Very similar to the Flamenco, it requires a haughty and confident attitude for the male.\\nThe United States first began taking notice of the dance in the 1930s, however it has never really caught on in the English-speaking countries because it is not a dance you can do without a lot of experience. For this reason, it is a great opportunity for seasoned dancers to learn something novel that will be received well by audiences.\\nA dynamic dance that requires extensive professional training, the Paso Doble is not a dance for the uninitiated. If you are a strong performer, however, few dances are as impressive or stylistic. If the conqueror is in your blood, step up to the challenge. Ole!

Although it can be defined as a blood sport, within the areas where it is practiced it is not considered a sport, since there are no elements of competition. Instead, it is considered a highly ritualized cultural event and art form which some see as deeply tied to Hispanic culture and identity.  \\n \\nThe bullfight, as it is practiced today, involves professional toreros (of whom the most senior, who actually kills the bull, is called a matador) who execute various formal moves which have a meaning, or at least a name, according to the bullfighter\\'s style or school. It has been alleged that toreros seek to elicit inspiration and art from their work and an emotional connection with the crowd transmitted through the bull. The close proximity places the bullfighter at risk of being gored or trampled by the bull. After the bull has been hooked multiple times behind the shoulder by other toreros in the arena, the bullfight usually concludes with the killing of the bull, ideally by a single sword thrust, which is called the estocada. Sometimes, the life of the bull is spared due to his braveness (indulto); once the animal has been treated, it is returned to live in the dehesa. Such pardons are nevertheless rare. In Portugal, the finale consists of a tradition called the pega, where men (forcados) try to grab and hold the bull by its horns when it runs at them.\\n\\nA special breed of cattle is used for bullfighting, and the bulls involved must be bred in large ranches, in conditions as similar as possible to the way they would behave in the wild.\\n\\nThere are many historic fighting venues in the Iberian Peninsula, France and Latin America. The largest venue of its kind is the Plaza M\\xc3\\xa9xico in central Mexico City, which seats 48,000 people,  and the oldest are the Plazas of B\\xc3\\xa9jar and Ronda, in the Spanish provinces of \\xc3\\x81vila and M\\xc3\\xa1laga.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nBullfighting traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice in Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean region. The first recorded bullfight may be the Epic of Gilgamesh, which describes a scene in which Gilgamesh and Enkidu fought and killed the Bull of Heaven (\"The Bull seemed indestructible, for hours they fought, till Gilgamesh dancing in front of the Bull, lured it with his tunic and bright weapons, and Enkidu thrust his sword, deep into the Bull\\'s neck, and killed it\").  Bull leaping was portrayed in Crete, and myths related to bulls throughout Greece. The killing of the sacred bull (tauroctony) is the essential central iconic act of Mithras, which was commemorated in the mithraeum wherever Roman soldiers were stationed. The oldest representation of what seems to be a man facing a bull is on the Celtiberian tombstone from Clunia and the cave painting El toro de hachos, both found in Spain.  \\n\\nBullfighting is often linked to Rome, where many human-versus-animal events were held as competition and entertainment, the Venationes. These hunting games spread to Africa, Europe and Asia during Roman times. There are also theories that it was introduced into Hispania by the Emperor Claudius, as a substitute for gladiators, when he instituted a short-lived ban on gladiatorial combat. The latter theory was supported by Robert Graves (picadors are related to warriors who wielded the javelin, but their role in the contest is now a minor one limited to \"preparing\" the bull for the matador.) Spanish colonists took the practice of breeding cattle and bullfighting to the American colonies, the Pacific and Asia. In the 19th century, areas of southern and southwestern France adopted bullfighting, developing their own distinctive form.\\n\\nReligious festivities and royal weddings were celebrated by fights in the local plaza, where noblemen would ride competing for royal favor, and the populace enjoyed the excitement. In the Middle Ages across Europe, knights would joust in competitions on horseback. In Spain, they began to fight bulls.\\n\\nIn medieval Spain bullfighting was considered a noble sport and reserved to the rich, who could afford to supply and train their animals. The bull was released into a closed arena where a single fighter on horseback was armed with a lance. This spectacle was said to be enjoyed by Charlemagne, Alfonso X the Wise and the Almohad caliphs, among others. The greatest Spanish performer of this art is said to have been El Cid.  According chronicle of the time, in 1128 \"... when Alfonso VII of Le\\xc3\\xb3n and Castile married Berengaria of Barcelona  daughter of Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona at \\nSalda\\xc3\\xb1a among other celebrations, there were also bullfights.\" \\n \\n\\nFrancisco Romero, from Ronda, Spain, is generally regarded as having been the first to introduce the practice of fighting bulls on foot around 1726, using the muleta in the last stage of the fight and an estoque to kill the bull. This type of fighting drew more attention from the crowds. Thus the modern corrida, or fight, began to take form, as riding noblemen were replaced by commoners on foot. This new style prompted the construction of dedicated bullrings, initially square, like the Plaza de Armas, and later round, to discourage the cornering of the action.\\n\\nThe modern style of Spanish bullfighting is credited to Juan Belmonte, generally considered the greatest matador of all time. Belmonte introduced a daring and revolutionary style, in which he stayed within a few centimetres of the bull throughout the fight. Although extremely dangerous (Belmonte was gored on many occasions), his style is still seen by most matadors as the ideal to be emulated.\\n\\nStyles\\n\\nOriginally, at least five distinct regional styles of bullfighting were practised in southwestern Europe: Andalusia, Aragon\\xe2\\x80\\x93Navarre, Alentejo, Camargue, Aquitaine. Over time, these have evolved more or less into standardized national forms mentioned below. The \"classic\" style of bullfight, in which the bull is killed, is the form practiced in Spain and many Latin American countries.\\n\\nSpanish\\n\\nSpanish-style bullfighting is called corrida de toros (literally \"running of bulls\") or la fiesta (\"the festival\"). In the traditional corrida, three matadores each fight two bulls, each of which is between four and six years old and weighs no less than 460\\xc2\\xa0kg (1,014\\xc2\\xa0lb)  Each matador has six assistants\\xe2\\x80\\x94two picadores (\"lancers on horseback\") mounted on horseback, three banderilleros \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who along with the matadors are collectively known as toreros (\"bullfighters\") \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and a mozo de espadas (\"sword page\"). Collectively they comprise a cuadrilla (\"entourage\"). In Spanish the more general torero is used for the lead fighter, and only when needed to distinguish a man is the full title matador de toros used; in English, \"matador\" is generally used for the bullfighter.\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nThe modern corrida is highly ritualized, with three distinct stages or tercios (\"thirds\"); the start of each being announced by a bugle sound. The participants enter the arena in a parade, called the pase\\xc3\\xadllo, to salute the presiding dignitary, accompanied by band music. Torero costumes are inspired by 17th-century Andalusian clothing, and matadores are easily distinguished by the gold of their traje de luces (\"suit of lights\"), as opposed to the lesser banderilleros, who are also known as toreros de plata (\"bullfighters of silver\").\\n\\nTercio de Varas\\n\\nThe bull is released into the ring, where he is tested for ferocity by the matador and banderilleros with the magenta and gold capote (\"cape\"). This is the first stage, the tercio de varas (\"the lancing third\"). The matador confronts the bull with the capote, performing a series of passes and observing the behavior and quirks of the bull.\\n\\nNext, a picador enters the arena on horseback armed with a vara (lance). To protect the horse from the bull\\'s horns, the animal wears a protective, padded covering called peto.  Prior to 1930, the horses did not wear any protection. Often the bull would disembowel the horse during this stage. Until the use of protection was instituted, the number of horses killed during a fiesta generally exceeded the number of bulls killed. \\n\\nAt this point, the picador stabs just behind the morrillo, a mound of muscle on the fighting bull\\'s neck, weakening the neck muscles and leading to the animal\\'s first loss of blood. The manner in which the bull charges the horse provides important clues to the matador about which side the bull favors. If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns slightly lower during the following stages of the fight. This ultimately enables the matador to perform the killing thrust later in the performance. The encounter with the picador often fundamentally changes the behaviour of a bull; distracted and unengaging bulls will become more focused and stay on a single target instead of charging at everything that moves.\\n\\nTercio de Banderillas\\n\\nIn the next stage, the tercio de banderillas (\"the third of banderillas\"), each of the three banderilleros attempts to plant two banderillas, sharp barbed sticks, into the bull\\'s shoulders. These anger and agitate, but further weaken, the bull. He tires from his  attacks on the horse and the damage he has taken from the lance. Sometimes a matador will place his own banderillas. If so, he usually embellishes this part of his performance and employs more varied manoeuvres than the standard al cuarteo method commonly used by banderilleros.\\n\\nTercio de Muerte\\n\\nIn the final stage, the tercio de muerte (\"the third of death\"), the matador re-enters the ring alone with a small red cape, or muleta, and a sword. It is a common misconception that the color red is supposed to anger the bull; the animals are colorblind.   The cape is thought to be red to mask the bull\\'s blood, although the color is now a matter of tradition. The matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes, which serve the dual purpose of wearing the animal down for the kill and creating an interesting display, or faena. He may also demonstrate his domination of the bull by caping and bringing it especially close to his body. The faena refers to the entire performance with the cape (muleta).\\n\\nIt is usually broken down into tandas, or \"series\", of passes. The series (tanda) ends with a final series of passes in which the matador, using the cape, tries to maneuver the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The sword is called estoque, and the act of thrusting the sword is called an estocada. During the initial series, while the matador in part is performing for the crowd, he uses a fake sword (estoque simulado). This is made of wood or aluminum, making it lighter and much easier to handle. The estoque de verdad (real sword) is made out of steel. At the end of the tercio de muerte, when the matador has finished \\nhis faena, he will change swords to take up the steel one. He performs the estocada and kills the bull with a pierce through the heart, if all goes according to plan. Many times the bull does not get pierced through the heart during the estocada initially, and repeated efforts must be made to bring the bull down and end his life.\\n\\nIf the matador has performed particularly well, the crowd may petition the president by waving white handkerchiefs to award the matador an ear of the bull. If his performance was exceptional, the president will award two ears. In certain more rural rings, the practice includes award of the bull\\'s tail. Very rarely, if the public or the matador believe that the bull has fought extremely bravely, the event\\'s president may be petitioned to grant the bull a pardon (indulto). If the indulto is granted, the bull\\'s life is spared; it leaves the ring alive and is returned to its home ranch. There the bull becomes a stud for the rest of his life.\\n\\nFile:Finito de C\\xc3\\xb3rdoba.jpg|First tercio: torero drawing a Ver\\xc3\\xb3nica.\\nFile:Rafael Ca\\xc3\\xb1ada \\xc3\\xa0 la cape.jpg|First tercio: matador making another kind of Ver\\xc3\\xb3nica.\\nFile:Banderillero Curro Molina.jpg|Second tercio: banderillero.\\nFile:Madrid Bullfight.JPG|Third tercio: faena of muleta.\\nFile:Uceda Leal.JPG|Third tercio: faena of muleta.\\n\\nRecortes\\n\\nRecortes, a style of bullfighting practiced in Navarre, La Rioja, north of Castile and Valencia, has been much less popular than the traditional corridas. But recortes have undergone a revival in Spain and are sometimes broadcast on TV.\\n\\nThis style was common in the early 19th century. Etchings by painter Francisco de Goya depict these events.\\n\\nRecortes claims to differ from a corrida in the following ways:\\n* The bull is not physically injured. Drawing blood is rare, and the bull is allowed to return to his pen at the end of the performance.\\n* The men are dressed in common street clothes rather than traditional bullfighting dress.\\n* Acrobatics are performed without the use of capes or other props. Performers attempt to evade the bull solely through the swiftness of their movements.\\n* Rituals are less strict, so the men have freedom to perform stunts as they please.\\n* Men work in teams but with less role distinction than in a corrida.\\n* Teams compete for points awarded by a jury.\\n\\nSince horses are not used, and performers are not professionals, recortes are less costly to produce.\\n\\nComic bullfighting\\n\\nComical spectacles based on bullfighting, called espect\\xc3\\xa1culos c\\xc3\\xb3mico-taurinos or charlotadas, are still popular in Spain and Mexico. Troupes include El empastre or El bombero torero. \\n\\nEncierros \\n\\nAn encierro or running of the bulls is an activity related to a bullfighting fiesta. Before the events that are held in the ring, people (usually young men) run in front of a small group of bulls that have been let loose, on a course of a sectioned-off subset of a town\\'s streets.\\n\\nToro embolado\\n\\nA toro embolado (in Spanish), bou embolat (in Catalan), roughly meaning \"bull with balls\", is a festive activity held at night and typical of many towns in Spain (mainly in the Valencian Community and Southern Catalonia). Balls of flammable material are attached to a bull\\'s horns. The balls are lit and the bull is set free in the streets at night; participants dodge the bull when it comes close. It can be considered a variant of an encierro (correbous in Catalan). This activity is held in a number of Spanish towns during their local festivals. In recent years, animal welfare activists have tried to stop the practice because of cruelty to the animal.    \\n\\nPortuguese\\n\\nMost Portuguese bullfights are held in two phases: the spectacle of the cavaleiro, and the pega. In the cavaleiro, a horseman on a Portuguese Lusitano horse (specially trained for the fights) fights the bull from horseback. The purpose of this fight is to stab three or four bandeiras (small javelins) into the back of the bull.\\n\\nIn the second stage, called the pega (\"holding\"), the forcados, a group of eight men, challenge the bull directly without any protection or weapon of defence. The front man provokes the bull into a charge to perform a pega de cara or pega de caras (face grab). The front man secures the animal\\'s head and is quickly aided by his fellows who surround and secure the animal until he is subdued.   Forcados are dressed in a traditional costume of damask or velvet, with long knitted hats as worn by the campinos (bull headers) from Ribatejo.\\n\\nThe bull is not killed in the ring and, at the end of the corrida, leading oxen are let into the arena and two campinos on foot herd the bull among them back to its pen. The bull is usually killed out of sight of the audience by a professional butcher. It can happen that some bulls, after an exceptional performance, are healed, released to pasture until their end days and used for breeding.\\n\\nIn the Portuguese Azores islands, there is a form of bullfighting called tourada \\xc3\\xa0 corda, in which a bull is led on a rope along a street, while players taunt and dodge the bull, who is not killed during or after the fight, but returned to pasture and used in later events.\\n\\nFrench\\n\\nSince the 19th century, Spanish-style corridas have been increasingly popular in Southern France where they enjoy legal protection in areas where there is an uninterrupted tradition of such bull fights, particularly during holidays such as Whitsun or Easter. Among France\\'s most important venues for bullfighting are the ancient Roman arenas of N\\xc3\\xaemes and Arles, although there are bull rings across the South from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coasts. Bullfights of this kind held in France are no different from those held in Spain and Latin America excepting minor cosmetic differences such as music. This is not to be confused with the bloodless bullfights referred to below which are indigenous to France.\\n\\nCourse camarguaise (course libre)\\n\\nA more indigenous genre of bullfighting is widely common in the Provence and Languedoc areas, and is known alternately as \"course libre\" or \"course camarguaise\". This is a bloodless spectacle (for the bulls) in which the objective is to snatch a rosette from the head of a young bull. The participants, or raseteurs, begin training in their early teens against young bulls from the Camargue region of Provence before graduating to regular contests held principally in Arles and N\\xc3\\xaemes but also in other Proven\\xc3\\xa7al and Languedoc towns and villages. Before the course, an abrivado\\xe2\\x80\\x94a \"running\" of the bulls in the streets\\xe2\\x80\\x94takes place, in which young men compete to outrun the charging bulls. The course itself takes place in a small (often portable) arena erected in a town square. For a period of about 15\\xe2\\x80\\x9320 minutes, the raseteurs compete to snatch rosettes (cocarde) tied between the bulls\\' horns. They do not take the rosette with their bare hands but with a claw-shaped metal instrument called a raset or crochet (hook) in their hands, hence their name. Afterwards, the bulls are herded back to their pen by gardians (Camarguais cowboys) in a bandido, amidst a great deal of ceremony. The stars of these spectacles are the bulls, who get top billing and stand to gain fame and statues in their honor, and lucrative product endorsement contracts. \\n\\nCourse landaise\\n\\nAnother type of French \\'bullfighting\\' is the \"course landaise\", in which cows are used instead of bulls. This is a competition between teams named cuadrillas, which belong to certain breeding estates. A cuadrilla is made up of a teneur de corde, an entra\\xc3\\xaeneur, a sauteur, and six \\xc3\\xa9carteurs. The cows are brought to the arena in crates and then taken out in order. The teneur de corde controls the dangling rope attached to the cow\\'s horns and the entra\\xc3\\xaeneur positions the cow to face and attack the player. The \\xc3\\xa9carteurs will try, at the last possible moment, to dodge around the cow and the sauteur will leap over it. Each team aims to complete a set of at least one hundred dodges and eight leaps. This is the main scheme of the \"classic\" form, the course landaise formelle. However, different rules may be applied in some competitions. For example, competitions for Coupe Jeannot Lafittau are arranged with cows without ropes.\\n\\nAt one point, it resulted in so many fatalities that the French government tried to ban it, but had to back down in the face of local opposition. The bulls themselves are generally fairly small, much less imposing than the adult bulls employed in the corrida. Nonetheless, the bulls remain dangerous due to their mobility and vertically formed horns. Participants and spectators share the risk; it is not unknown for angry bulls to smash their way through barriers and charge the surrounding crowd of spectators. The course landaise is not seen as a dangerous sport by many, but \\xc3\\xa9carteur Jean-Pierre Rachou died in 2003 when a bull\\'s horn tore his femoral artery.\\n\\nSimilar customs in other countries \\n\\nTamil Nadu (India)\\n\\nJallikattu is a traditional bull-taming sport played in Tamil Nadu, India as a part of Pongal celebrationson Mattu Pongal day. Bulls are bred specifically for the sporting event and a specific breed of cattle bred for this purpose is known as \"Jellicut\".  In May 2014, the Supreme Court of India banned the sport citing animal welfare issues, although the sport does not involve killing the animal.  On 8 January 2016, the Government of India passed an order exempting Jallikattu from all performances where bulls can not be used, effectively reversing the ban.  This order of the Government of India was overturned by the  Supreme Court by its judgement on 12 January 2016 and will be effective at least for one year.\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\n  \\nFreestyle bullfighting is a style of bullfighting developed in American rodeo. The style was developed by the rodeo clowns who protect bull riders from being trampled or gored by an angry bull. Freestyle bullfighting is a 70-second competition in which the bullfighter (rodeo clown) avoids the bull by means of dodging, jumping and use of a barrel.\\nCompetitions are organized in the US as the \"World\" Bullfighting Championship (WBC) and the Dickies National Bullfighting Championship under auspices of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR).\\n\\nA distinct type of bloodless bullfighting is practised in California\\'s Central Valley. In this historically Portuguese-settled area, a form of bullfight has developed in which the bull is taunted by a matador, but the lances are tipped with velcro and aimed at velcro patches secured to the bull\\'s shoulder. Fights occur from May through October around traditional Portuguese holidays. \\n\\nTanzania\\n\\nBullfighting was introduced by the Portuguese to Zanzibar and to Pemba Island, in modern Tanzania, where it is known as mchezo wa ngombe. Similar to the Portuguese Azorean tourada a corda, the bull is restrained by a rope, generally neither bull nor player is harmed, and the bull is not killed at the end of the fight.  \\n\\nBull wrestling (bull against bull)\\n\\n \\nBull wrestling, or bull fighting, is a bloodsport between bulls found in some parts of the world, such as in India (known as dhirio), Japan (t\\xc5\\x8dgy\\xc5\\xab),  Balkans (korida),  Turkey (bo\\xc4\\x9fa g\\xc3\\xbcre\\xc5\\x9fi, literally \"bull wrestling\"),  Persian Gulf,   and Southeast Asia, in which the bulls lock horns (under varied rules). This form of bullfighting is also practiced in western Kenya.\\n\\nHazards\\n\\nSpanish-style bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, but it is also dangerous for the matador. Matadors are usually gored every season, with picadors and banderilleros being gored less often. With the discovery of antibiotics and advances in surgical techniques, fatalities are now rare, although over the past three centuries 534 professional bullfighters have died in the ring or from injuries sustained there, most recently matador Victor Barrio on 10 July 2016, whose death was broadcast on live TV.  \\n\\nSome matadors, notably Juan Belmonte, have been seriously gored many times: according to Ernest Hemingway, Belmonte\\'s legs were marred by many ugly scars. A special type of surgeon has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat cornadas, or horn-wounds.\\n\\nThe bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida, and where a priest can be found in case a sacrament is needed. The most relevant sacrament is now called \"Anointing of the Sick\"; it was formerly known as \"Extreme Unction\", or the \"Last Rites\".\\n\\nThe media often reports the more horrific of bullfighting injuries, such as the September 2011 goring of matador Juan Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Padilla\\'s head by a bull in Zaragoza, resulting in the loss of his left eye, use of his right ear, and facial paralysis. He returned to bullfighting five months later with an eyepatch, multiple titanium plates in his skull, and the nickname \\'The Pirate\\'. \\n\\nCultural aspects\\n\\nMany supporters of bullfighting regard it as a deeply ingrained, integral part of their national cultures; in Spain it is called \"La fiesta nacional\", literally \"the national festival\". The aesthetic of bullfighting is based on the interaction of the man and the bull. Rather than a competitive sport, the bullfight is more of a ritual of ancient origin, which is judged by aficionados (bullfighting fans) based on artistic impression and command. Ernest Hemingway said of it in his 1932 non-fiction book Death in the Afternoon: \"Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter\\'s honour.\" Bullfighting is seen as a symbol of Spanish culture. \\n\\nThe bullfight is regarded as a demonstration of style, technique and courage by its participants and as a demonstration of cruelty and cowardice by its critics. While there is usually no doubt about the outcome, the bull is not viewed by bullfighting supporters as a sacrificial victim \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it is instead seen by the audience as a worthy adversary, deserving of respect in its own right.\\n\\nThose who oppose bullfighting maintain that the practice is a cowardly, sadistic tradition of torturing, humiliating and killing a bull amidst pomp and pageantry.  Supporters of bullfights, called \"aficionados\", claim they respect the bulls, that the bulls live better than other cattle, and that bullfighting is a grand tradition; a form of art important to their culture. \\n\\nWomen in bullfighting\\n\\nSee also: List of female bullfighters\\n\\nPatricia McCormick began bullfighting as a professional Matadora in January 1952, and was the first American to do so. Bette Ford was the first American woman to fight on foot in the Plaza M\\xc3\\xa9xico, the world\\'s largest bullfight arena. \\n\\nConchita Cintron was a Peruvian female bullfighter, perhaps the most famous in the history of bullfighting.\\n\\nIn 1974, Angela Hernandez (also known as Angela Hernandez Gomez and just Angela), of Spain, won a case in the Spanish Supreme Court allowing women to be bullfighters in Spain; a prohibition against women doing so was put in place in Spain in 1908.   Cristina S\\xc3\\xa1nchez de Pablos, of Spain, was one of the first female bullfighters to gain prominence; she debuted as a bullfighter in Madrid on 13 February 1993.\\n\\nPopularity, controversy, and criticism\\n\\nPopularity\\n\\nIn Spain, opposition to bullfighting is referred to as the antitaurino movement. Supporters of a ban on bullfighting remain a minority in Spain. About 30% of Spaniards support bullfighting in Spain. Despite its slow decrease in popularity among younger generations, it remains a widespread cultural activity with millions of followers throughout the country.\\n\\nAnimal welfare\\n\\n \\nMany people, including animal rights and animal welfare advocates, consider this is a cruel, barbaric blood sport in which the bull suffers severe stress, and may ultimately end in a slow, torturous death.     A number of animal rights and animal welfare groups undertake anti-bullfighting actions in Spain and other countries. \\n\\nRSPCA assistant director for public affairs, David Bowles, said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe RSPCA is strongly opposed to bullfighting. It is an inhumane and outdated practice that continues to lose support, including from those living in the countries where this takes place such as Spain, Portugal and France.\" \\n\\nBullfighting guide The Bulletpoint Bullfight warns that bullfighting is \"not for the squeamish\", advising spectators to \"Be prepared for blood.\" The guide details prolonged and profuse bleeding caused by horse-mounted lancers; the charging by the bull of a blindfolded, armored horse who is \"sometimes doped up, and unaware of the proximity of the bull\"; the placing of barbed darts by banderilleros; followed by the matador\\'s fatal sword thrust. The guide stresses that these procedures are a normal part of bullfighting and that death is rarely instantaneous. The guide further warns those attending bullfights to \"Be prepared to witness various failed attempts at killing the animal before it lies down.\" \\n\\nOthers, such as author Alexander Fiske-Harrison have argued that there are mitigating circumstances to this: \"In terms of animal welfare, the fighting bull lives four to six years whereas the meat cow lives one to two. What is more, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just live in the sense of existing, it lives a full and natural life. Those years are spent free roaming in the dehesa, the lightly wooded natural pastureland which is the residue of the ancient forests of Spain. It is a rural idyll, although with the modern additions of full veterinary care and an absence of predators big enough to threaten evolution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s answer to a main battle tank.\" Other arguments include that the death of animals in slaughterhouses is very often worse than the death in the ring, and that both types of animal die for entertainment since humans do not need to consume meat, eating it instead for taste (bulls enter the food chain after the bullfight). \\n\\nFunding\\n\\nThe question of public funding is particularly controversial in Spain, since widely disparaged claims have been made by supporters and opponents of bullfighting. According to government figures, bullfighting in Spain generates 1600 million euros a year and 200,000 jobs, 57000 of which are directly linked to the industry. Furthermore, bullfighting is the cultural activity which generates the most tax revenue for the Spanish state (45 million euros in VAT tax and over 12 million in social security).\\n\\nCritics claim often that bullfighting is financed with public money. However, despite bullfighting involving around 25 million spectators annually, it represents just 0.01% of those state subsidies allocated to cultural activities, and always under 3% of the cultural budget of regional, provincial and local authorities. The bulk of subsidies are paid by local town halls where there is a historical tradition and support for bullfighting and related events, which are often held without charge to participants and spectators. The European Union does not subsidize bullfighting but it does subsidize the cattle farming in general, which benefits also benefit those who rear Spanish fighting bulls. \\n\\nIn 2015, 438 of 687 Members of the European Parliament (MEP) voted in favour of amending the 2016 E.U. budget to indicate that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP) appropriations or any other appropriations from the budget should not be used for the financing of lethal bullfighting activities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. While the E.U. cannot legislate to ban bullfighting, it can stop granting farming subsidies to bull breeders. These subsidies have been keeping practice of bullfighting alive.  \\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nLate-19th-century / early-20th-century Fin-de-si\\xc3\\xa8cle Spanish regeneracionista some intellectuals protested against what they called the policy of pan y toros (\"bread and bulls\"), an analogue of Roman panem et circenses promoted by politicians to keep the populace content in its oppression. Such belief was part of the wider current of thought known as anti-flamenquismo whereby they simultaneously campaigned against the popularity of both bullfighting and flamenco music, which they believed to be \"oriental\" elements of Spanish culture which were responsible for Spain\\'s backwardness as compared to the rest of Europe. During the Franco dictatorship, bullfights were supported by the state as something genuinely Spanish, as the fiesta nacional, so that bullfights became associated with the regime and, for this reason, many thought they would decline after the transition to democracy, but this did not happen. The government of Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Luis Rodr\\xc3\\xadguez Zapatero, was the first to be more opposed to bullfighting, prohibiting children under 14 from attending and limiting or prohibiting the broadcast of bullfights on national TV, although the latter measure was reversed after his party lost the elections in 2011. Nevertheless, his party is overall not opposed to bullfighting and anti-bullfighting measures have only been passed in municipalities where it governs in coalition with the far-left party Podemos which has taken a clearer anti-bullfighting stance. However, even Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has recently stated that even though he is opposed to it, he would not illegalize bullfighting if his party came to power. \\n\\nSome in Spain despise bullfighting because of its association with the Spanish nation and the Franco regime.  Despite its long history in Barcelona, in 2010 bullfighting was outlawed across the Catalonia region, following a campaign led by an animal rights civic platform called \"Prou!\" (\"Enough!\" in Catalan). Critics have argued that the ban was motivated by issues of Catalan independentism.\\n\\nThe Spanish Royal Family is divided on the issue, from Queen Sof\\xc3\\xada who does not hide her dislike for bullfights;  to King Juan Carlos who occasionally presides over a bullfight from the royal box as part of his official duties;    to their daughter Princess Elena who is well known for her liking of bullfights and who often accompanies the king in the presiding box or attends privately in the general seating. \\nThe King has allegedly stated that \"the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU\". \\n\\nPro-bullfighting supporters include the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his party (Partido Popular), as well as most leaders of the major left-leaning opposition PSOE Party, including former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the current Presidents of Andalusia, Extremadura and Castilla-La-Mancha. Nevertheless, former PSOE Prime Minister Zapatero was more lukewarm towards the Fiesta, and under his government there was a 6-year ban on live bullfights broadcast on the state-run national TV Channel. This has been lifted since his government was voted out in 2011. Live Bullfights are shown at the traditional 6 p.m. time on TVE as of September 2012. \\n\\nReligion\\n\\nBullfighting has been seen as intertwined with religion and religious folklore in Spain at a popular level, particularly in the areas where it is most popular.    Bullfighting events and festivities are as a rule celebrated as a core (yet profane) element of religious festivities celebrating local Patron Saints, always along a range of other festive activities. On the other hand, the Bullfighting world is also inextricably linked to religious iconography involved with religious devotion in Spain, with Bullfighters seeking the protection of various Virgins and often being members of religious brotherhoods.  \\n\\nMedia prohibitions\\n\\nState-run Spanish TVE had cancelled live coverage of bullfights in August 2007 until September 2012, claiming that the coverage was too violent for children who might be watching, and that live coverage violated a voluntary, industry-wide code attempting to limit \"sequences that are particularly crude or brutal\".  In October 2008, in a statement to Congress, Luis Fern\\xc3\\xa1ndez, the President of Spanish State Broadcaster TVE, confirmed that the station will no longer broadcast live bullfights due to the high cost of production and a rejection of the events by advertisers. However the station will continue to broadcast \\'Tendido Cero\\', a bullfighting magazine programme.  Having the national Spanish TV stop broadcasting it, after 50 years of history, was considered a big step for its abolition. Nevertheless, other regional and private channels keep broadcasting it with good audiences. \\n\\nThe Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his government have lifted the ban on live bullfights being shown on TVE and live bullfights are now shown at the traditional 6 p.m. time on TVE as of September 2012.\\n\\nA Portuguese television station stopped broadcasting of bullfights in January 2008, on the grounds that they were too violent for minors. \\n\\nDeclaration as Cultural Patrimony\\n\\nA growing list of Spanish, French and South American cities and regions have started to formally declare their celebrations of bullfighting part of their protected cultural patrimony. Most of these declarations have come into place as a counter-reaction in the aftermath of the 2010 ban in Catalonia. \\n\\nAs of April 2012, the latest addition to this list is the Andalusian City of Seville. \\n\\nBans\\n\\nPre-20th century\\n\\nIn November 1567, Pope Pius V issued a papal bull titled De Salute Gregis and forbidding fighting of bulls and any other beasts as the voluntary risk to life endangered the soul of the combatants, but it was abolished eight years later by his successor, Pope Gregory\\xc2\\xa0XIII, at the request of King Philip\\xc2\\xa0II.\\n\\nBullfighting was introduced in Uruguay in 1776 by Spain and abolished by Uruguayan law in February 1912. Bullfighting was also introduced in Argentina by Spain, but after Argentina\\'s independence, the event drastically diminished in popularity and was abolished in 1899 under law 2786. \\n\\nBullfighting was present in Cuba during its colonial period, but was abolished by the United States military under the pressure of civic associations right after the Spanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93American War in 1901.  Bullfighting was also banned for a period in Mexico in 1890; consequently some Spanish bullfighters moved to the United States to transfer their skills to the American rodeos. \\n\\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, bullfighting in Spain was banned at several occasions  (for instance by Philip\\xc2\\xa0V), but always reinstituted later by other governments.\\n\\nBullfighting had some popularity in the Philippines during Spanish rule, though foreign commentators derided the quality of local bulls and toreros.   Bullfighting was noted in the Philippines as early as 1619, when it was among the festivities in celebration of Pope Urban III\\'s authorisation of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.  Following the Spanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93American War, the Americans suppressed the custom in the Philippines under the tenure of Governor General Leonard Wood, and it was replaced with a now-popular Filipino sport, basketball. \\n\\n20th century onwards\\n\\nBullfighting is now banned in many countries; people taking part in such activity would be liable for terms of imprisonment for animal cruelty. \"Bloodless\" variations, though, are permitted and have attracted a following in California, Texas, and France.  In southern France, however, the traditional form of the corrida still exists and it is protected by French law. However, in June 2015 The Paris Court of Appeals removed bullfighting/\"le corrida\" from France\\'s cultural heritage list.    While it is not very popular in Texas, bullfighting is legal (the only U.S. state to allow it), and both bloodless and pure forms of bullfighting occur at rodeos in small Texas towns.[http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?sectionnews/local&id\\n6200136 Bullfighting is coming to Ft. Bend County | abc13.com]\\n\\nIn 1991, the Canary Islands became the first Spanish Autonomous Community to ban bullfighting, when they legislated to ban bullfights and other spectacles that involve cruelty to animals, with the exception of cockfighting, which is traditional in some towns in the Islands. \\nSome supporters of bullfighting and even Lorenzo Olarte Cullen,  Canarian head of government at the time, have argued that the fighting bull is not a \"domestic animal\" and hence the law does not ban bullfighting. \\nThe absence of spectacles since 1984 would be due to lack of demand.\\nIn the rest of Spain, national laws against cruelty to animals have abolished most blood sports, but specifically exempt bullfighting.\\n\\nSeveral cities around the world (especially in Catalonia) have symbolically declared themselves to be Anti-Bullfighting Cities, including Barcelona in 2006. This was symbolic, as the city did not have the power to stop it. However, on 1 January 2012, it became prohibited in Catalonia (including Barcelona, the capital of this region) after a ban passed in the Regional Government in July 2010 came into effect in 2012. \\n\\nCatalonia\\n\\nOn 18 December 2009, the parliament of Catalonia, one of Spain\\'s seventeen Autonomous Communities, approved by majority the preparation of a law to ban bullfighting in Catalonia, as a response to a popular initiative against bullfighting that gathered more than 180,000 signatures.  On  2010, with the two main parties allowing their members a free vote, the ban was passed 68 to 55, with 9 abstentions. This meant Catalonia became the second Community of Spain  (first was Canary Islands in 1991), and the first on the mainland, to ban bullfighting. The ban took effect on 1 January 2012, and affects only the one remaining functioning Catalonian bullring, the Plaza de toros Monumental de Barcelona. \\nIt does not affect the correbous, a traditional game of the Ebro area (south of Catalonia) where lighted flares are attached to a bull\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horns. The correbous are seen mainly in the municipalities in the south of Tarragona, with the exceptions of a few other towns in other provinces of Catalonia. The name correbous is essentially Catalan and Valencian; in other parts of Spain they have other names.[http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_27265.shtml#ixzz10NKQxwpk Now Cataloniaa votes to protect the torture of bulls]\\n\\nThere is a movement to revoke the ban in the Spanish congress, citing the value of bullfighting as \"cultural heritage\". The proposal is backed by the majority of parliamentarians. \\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nIn Costa Rica the law prohibits the killing of bulls and other animals in public and private shows. \\n\\nEcuador\\n\\nEcuador staged bullfights to the death for over three centuries due to being a former Spanish colony. On 12 December 2010, Ecuador\\'s president Rafael Correa announced that in an upcoming referendum, the country would be asked whether to ban bullfighting;    in the referendum, held in May 2011, the Ecuadorians agreed on banning the final killing of the bull that happens in a corrida.  This means the bull is no longer killed before the public, and is instead taken back inside the barn to be killed at the end of the event. The other parts of the corrida are still performed the same way as before in the cities that celebrate it.[http://quaker-animals.co.uk/?p=2650 Analysis Of The Ecuador Referendum \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bullfight] This part of the referendum is applied on a regional level, meaning that in regions where the population voted against the ban, which are the same regions where bullfighting is celebrated the most, killing the animal publicly in the bullfighting plaza is still performed. The main bullfighting celebration of the country, the Fiesta Brava in Quito was still allowed to take place in December 2011 after the referendum under these new rules. \\n\\nMexico\\n\\nBullfighting has been banned in three Mexican states: Sonora in 2013, Guerrero in 2014 and Coahuila in 2015. \\n\\nIndia\\n\\nAnimal activists and PETA India have protested against Jallikattu over the years.  The Animal Welfare Board of India filed a case in the Supreme Court of India for an outright ban on Jallikattu because of the cruelty to animals and the threat to public safety involved. On 27 November 2010, the Supreme Court permitted the Government of Tamil Nadu to allow Jallikattu for five months in a year and directed the District Collectors to make sure that the animals that participate in Jallikattu are registered to the Animal Welfare Board and in return the Board would send its representative to monitor over the event. The Government of Tamil Nadu ordered that  be deposited by the organizers in case of an accident or injury during the event and enacted a rule to allow a team of veterinarians would be present at the venue for certifying the bulls for participation in the event and to provide treatment for bulls that get injured. \\n\\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests issued a notification in 2011 that banned the use of bulls as performing animals, thereby banning the sport.  But the sport was continued to be held under Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act No 27 of 2009. On 7 May 2014, the Supreme Court of India struck down the state law and banned the sport. The Supreme Court noted that any flouting of the ban should result in penalties for cruelty to animals under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.  The court also asked the Government of India to amend the law on preventing cruelty to animals to bring bulls within its ambit. On 8 January 2016, the Ministry of Environment and Forests permitted the continuation of the sport under certain conditions effectively ending the ban.'>, 'answer': <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'France'>}\n"
